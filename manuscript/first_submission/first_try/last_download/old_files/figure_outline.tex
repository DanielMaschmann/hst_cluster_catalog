next steps

produce 2 tables
1st table magnitude limits done

2nd table fit results (stellar masses ages  ebv )

use open circle in Figure 5 for incomplete samples





figure 1
figure of one galaxy showcasing all data

figure 2
footprints

figure
apparent magnitude of all galaxies

figure 3 
absolute V-band magnitude histograms 38 galaxies

figure 4 
abs v-band and stellar mass vs distance
after vetting catalogs, consider changing from brightest/most-massive cluster to 98th percentile or 5th brightest, etc.

figure 5 
# Counts vs specific star formation rate of hist galaxy

figure 6
first presentation of the color color diagram using the ML sample

figure 7 
distribution of color color diagram difference between human and ML plus introduce the BC03 Model

figure 8 + 9
color color diagram as a panel with ML contours + Human dots

figure 10 
SED fit plot showing SED fit of some representative clusters

figure 11 + 12
panel of age - reddening figure ML

figure 13 + 14 
panel of age - stellar mass distribution ML 
+ add cut for completeness
