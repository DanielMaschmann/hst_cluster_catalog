New Plots for Paper

(1)
3 x 3 grid for human classified sample, including solar metallicity track, reddening vector
columns: C1 | C2 | C3
rows:
NUV-B,V-I
U-B, V-I
B-V, V-I

(2)
1 x 3 grid for machine learning sample, including solar metallicity track, reddening vector
mass>1e4
5000<mass<1e4
mass<5000

(3) spatial distribution maps 
will need to experiment with how to display
check out http://physics.uwyo.edu/~turner/research/correlation/app/ and click on outline plots to see an example.  the blue ellipses in the plots represent molecular clouds.

--> remove figure 16 and age-mass diagrams.  SED fitting issues will go into Dave's paper

--> to characterize globular cluster clump: report some kind of centroid and compute contours enclosing 68\% and 95\% of the points

--> to characterize the middle-age population: take slices parallel to the reddening vector, and plot the histogram for each slice.
