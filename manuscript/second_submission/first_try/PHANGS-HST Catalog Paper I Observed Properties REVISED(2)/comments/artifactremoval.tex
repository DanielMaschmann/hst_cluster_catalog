artefact removal steps for ML catalog! 


step 1) first human inspection
flag all objects in the ML catalog which have been previously flagged by Dave as an artefact.
NOTE: In the internal release these objects were not removed from the ML catalog and still made it into the ML catalogs.

step 2) second human inspection
flag all objects that were classified as artefacts by Chris and Lucious. Unfortunately there is only a large overlap with the objects which have been flagged by Brad

step 3) red stars
flag red stars. This means we are flagging objects with V-I > 2.0 and CI < 1.45 This was a criterion suggested by Brad

step 4) diffraction spikes
flag all objects that are co-spatial with diffraction spike masks provided by Kirsten. 
NOTE: There are only masks for galaxies which have bright foreground stars. and only representative filters. Mostly F275W and F814W to cover the blue and the red end of this effect. However in some cases more observations where taken with different telescope orientation angles and therefore more masks were produced. We stacked all the masks and flagged objects which have been associated with the combined masks.


General Note: This procedure was also applied to the human catalogs. In general nothing was flagged but in some individual cases red stars or diffraction spikes have been flagged. This made total decrease of 25 in the human catalogs.



statistics: 
we use the following hierarchy for the flagging: first-insp, second-insp, red-star, 
diffract. Here an example what this means: To avoid double counts an object which was flagged by the first human inspection cannot be counted as for example as a diffraction spike
