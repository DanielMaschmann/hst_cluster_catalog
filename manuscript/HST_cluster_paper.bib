	abstract = {Using PHANGS-HST NUV-U-B-V-I imaging of 17 nearby spiral galaxies, we study samples of star clusters and stellar associations, visually selected to be bright and relatively isolated, for three purposes: to compute aperture corrections for star cluster photometry, to explore the utility of quantitative morphologies in the analysis of clusters and associations, and to compare to synthetic stellar population models. We provide a technical summary of our procedures to determine aperture corrections, a standard step in the production of star cluster candidate catalogues, and compare to prior work. We also use this specialized sample to launch an analysis into the measurement of star cluster light profiles. We focus on one measure, M20 (normalized second-order moment of the brightest 20 per cent of pixels), applied previously to study the morphologies of galaxies. We find that M20 in combination with UB-VI colours, yields a parameter space where distinct loci are formed by single-peaked symmetric clusters, single-peaked asymmetric clusters, and multipeaked associations. We discuss the potential applications for using M20 to gain insight into the formation and evolution of clusters and associations. Finally, we compare the colour distributions of this sample with various synthetic stellar population models. One finding is that the standard procedure of using a single-metallicity SSP track to fit the entire population of clusters in a given galaxy should be revisited, as the oldest globular clusters will be more metal-poor compared to clusters formed recently.},

	abstract = {We present an innovative and widely applicable approach for the detection and classification of stellar clusters, developed for the PHANGS-HST Treasury Program, an NUV-to-I band imaging campaign of 38 spiral galaxies. Our pipeline first generates a unified master source list for stars and candidate clusters, to enable a self-consistent inventory of all star formation products. To distinguish cluster candidates from stars, we introduce the Multiple Concentration Index (MCI) parameter, and measure inner and outer MCIs to probe morphology in more detail than with a single, standard concentration index (CI). We improve upon cluster candidate selection, jointly basing our criteria on expectations for MCI derived from synthetic cluster populations and existing cluster catalogues, yielding model and semi-empirical selection regions (respectively). Selection purity (confirmed clusters versus candidates, assessed via human-based classification) is high (up to 70 per cent) for moderately luminous sources in the semi-empirical selection region, and somewhat lower overall (outside the region or fainter). The number of candidates rises steeply with decreasing luminosity, but pipeline-integrated Machine Learning (ML) classification prevents this from being problematic. We quantify the performance of our PHANGS-HST methods in comparison to LEGUS for a sample of four galaxies in common to both surveys, finding overall agreement with 50-75 per cent of human verified star clusters appearing in both catalogues, but also subtle differences attributable to specific choices adopted by each project. The PHANGS-HST ML-classified Class 1 or 2 catalogues reach {\textasciitilde}1 mag fainter, {\textasciitilde}2 × lower stellar mass, and are 2-5 × larger in number, than attained in the human classified samples.},

              m images. At the simplest level, we distinguish five environments: centres, bars, spiral arms, interarm regions, and discs without strong spirals. Slightly more sophisticated masks include rings and lenses, which are publicly released but not explicitly used in this paper. We examine trends with environment in the molecular gas content, star formation rate, and depletion time using PHANGS–ALMA CO(2–1) intensity maps and tracers of star formation. The interarm regions and discs without strong spirals clearly dominate in area, whereas molecular gas and star formation are quite evenly distributed among the five basic environments. We reproduce the molecular Kennicutt–Schmidt relation with a slope compatible with unity within the uncertainties and without significant slope differences among environments. In contrast to what has been suggested by early studies, we find that bars are not always deserts devoid of gas and star formation, but instead they show large diversity. Similarly, spiral arms do not account for most of the gas and star formation in disc galaxies, and they do not have shorter depletion times than the interarm regions. Spiral arms accumulate gas and star formation, without systematically boosting the star formation efficiency. Centres harbour remarkably high surface densities and on average shorter depletion times than other environments. Centres of barred galaxies show higher surface densities and wider distributions compared to the outer disc; yet, depletion times are similar to unbarred galaxies, suggesting highly intermittent periods of star formation when bars episodically drive gas inflow, without enhancing the central star formation efficiency permanently. In conclusion, we provide quantitative evidence that stellar structures in galaxies strongly affect the organisation of molecular gas and star formation, but their impact on star formation efficiency is more subtle.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present the GALEX-SDSS-WISE Legacy Catalog (GSWLC), a catalog of physical properties (stellar masses, dust attenuations, and star formation rates [SFRs]) for ∼700,000 galaxies with Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) redshifts below 0.3. GSWLC contains galaxies within the Galaxy Evolution Explorer footprint, regardless of a UV detection, covering 90\% of SDSS. The physical properties were obtained from UV/optical spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting following Bayesian methodology of Salim et al., with improvements such as blending corrections for low-resolution UV photometry, flexible dust attenuation laws, and emission-line corrections. GSWLC also includes mid-IR SFRs derived from IR templates based on 22 μ \{\{m\}\} Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer observations. These estimates are independent of UV/optical SED fitting, in order to separate possible systematics. The paper argues that the comparison of specific SFRs (sSFRs) is more informative and physically motivated than the comparison of SFRs. The sSFRs resulting from the UV/optical SED fitting are compared to the mid-IR sSFRs and to sSFRs from three published catalogs. For “main-sequence” galaxies with no active galactic nucleus (AGN) all sSFRs are in very good agreement (within 0.1 dex on average). In particular, the widely used aperture-corrected SFRs from the MPA/JHU catalog show no systematic offsets, in contrast to some integral field spectroscopy results. For galaxies below the main sequence (log sSFR {\textless} -11), mid-IR (s)SFRs based on fixed luminosity-SFR conversion are severely biased (up to 2 dex) because the dust is primarily heated by old stars. Furthermore, mid-IR (s)SFRs are overestimated by up to 0.6 dex for galaxies with AGNs, presumably due to nonstellar dust heating. UV/optical (s)SFRs are thus preferred to IR-based (s)SFRs for quenched galaxies and those that host AGNs.},

We find a significant nonlinear slope of the relation, SFRvpropM 0.6 sstarf, and a constant observed scatter of 0.34 dex, independent of redshift and M sstarf. However, if we select only blue galaxies we find a linear relation SFRvpropM sstarf, similar to previous results at z = 0 by Peng et al. This selection excludes red, dusty, star-forming galaxies with higher masses, which brings down the slope. By selecting on L IR/L UV (a proxy for dust obscuration) and the rest-frame U - V colors, we show that star-forming galaxies fall in three distinct regions of the log(SFR)-log(M sstarf) plane: (1) actively star-forming galaxies with "normal" dust obscuration and associated colors (54\% for log (M sstarf) {\textgreater} 10 at 1 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.5), (2) red star-forming galaxies with low levels of dust obscuration and low-specific SFRs (11\%), and (3) dusty, blue star-forming galaxies with high-specific SFRs (7\%). The remaining 28\% comprises quiescent galaxies. Galaxies on the "normal" star formation sequence show strong trends of increasing dust attenuation with stellar mass and a decreasing specific SFR, with an observed scatter of 0.25 dex. The dusty, blue galaxies reside in the upper envelope of the star formation sequence with remarkably similar spectral shapes at all masses, suggesting that the same physical process is dominating the stellar light. The red, low-dust star-forming galaxies may be in the process of shutting off and migrating to the quiescent population.},

A local sky brightness and a magnitude are computed for each star in each of the specified stellar apertures, and for crowded fields, the empirical point-spread function must then be obtained for each data frame. The GROUP routine divides the star list for a given frame into optimum subgroups, and then the NSTAR routine is used to obtain photometry for all the stars in the frame by means of least- squares profile fits. The process is illustrated with images of stars in a crowded field, and shortcomings and possible improvements of the program are considered.},

These large numbers motivated the development of a more objective and repeatable method to help perform source classifications. In this paper, we consider the results for five PHANGS-HST galaxies (NGC 628, NGC 1433, NGC 1566, NGC 3351, NGC 3627) using classifications from two convolutional neural network architectures (RESNET and VGG) trained using deep transfer learning techniques. The results are compared to classifications performed by humans. The primary result is that the neural network classifications are comparable in quality to the human classifications with typical agreement around 70 to 80 per cent for Class 1 clusters (symmetric, centrally concentrated) and 40 to 70 per cent for Class 2 clusters (asymmetric, centrally concentrated). If Class 1 and 2 are considered together the agreement is 82 ± 3 per cent. Dependencies on magnitudes, crowding, and background surface brightness are examined. A detailed description of the criteria and methodology used for the human classifications is included along with an examination of systematic differences between PHANGS-HST and LEGUS. The distribution of data points in a colour-colour diagram is used as a 'figure of merit' to further test the relative performances of the different methods. The effects on science results (e.g. determinations of mass and age functions) of using different cluster classification methods are examined and found to be minimal.},

The offset between gas and young clusters in the inner arms is consistent with the expectations for a density wave. Clusters as old as a few hundred Myr remain concentrated close to the spiral arms, although the distributions are broader than those for the youngest clusters, which is also consistent with predictions from density wave simulations. The outermost portion of the west arm is different from the rest of the spiral structure in that it contains primarily intermediate-age (≈ 100\{--\}400 \{Myr\}) clusters; we believe that this is a “material” arm. We have identified four “feathers,” stellar structures beyond the inner arms that have a larger pitch angle than the arms.

	abstract = {We present a framework for understanding the demographics of star cluster systems and develop a toy model that incorporates a universal initial power-law mass function, selected formation histories, selected disruption laws, and a convolution with common artifacts and selection effects found in observational data. A wide variety of observations can be explained by this simple model, including the observed correlation between the brightest young cluster in a galaxy and the total number of young clusters. The model confirms that this can be understood as a statistical size-of-sample effect rather than a difference in the physical process responsible for the formation of the clusters, suggesting that active mergers have the brightest clusters simply because they have the most clusters. A comparison is made of different cluster disruption laws, and it is shown that the break in the dN/dτ diagram used to determine the parameters in the Boutloukos \& Lamers model may be produced by incompleteness near the break point. A model of the Antennae galaxies is developed and compared with the observational data; this extends the mass-age range for cluster comparison over previous studies. An important component of our model is the use of a ``two-stage'' disruption process, with a very high ``infant mortality'' rate for the clusters with ages less than {\textasciitilde}108 yr (i.e., roughly 80\%- 90\% are lost each factor of 10 in time, τ, independent of mass), and two-body relaxation, which becomes the dominant disruption mechanism at older ages, preferentially removing the lower mass clusters. Hence, in our model, stars from the dissolved clusters form the field population. We note that a 90\% infant mortality rate for each factor of 10 in τ (i.e., dN/dτ{\textasciitilde}τ-1) is consistent with all measured young cluster populations, including those in the Antennae, the Small Magellanic Cloud, and the Milky Way. In fact, the population of clusters in the Antennae can be viewed as a scaled-up version of the Milky Way in many respects, with a scale factor of roughly 1000 times the Lada \& Lada sample of embedded star clusters in the local Milky Way. We find no evidence for a truncation of the Antennae cluster mass function at the high-mass end.

We report on the use of the publicly available Code Investigating GALaxy Emission (CIGALE) SED fitting package to derive ages, stellar masses, and reddenings for star clusters identified in the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS-HST (PHANGS-HST) survey. Using samples of star clusters in the galaxy NGC 3351, we present results of benchmark analyses performed to validate the code and a comparison to SED fitting results from the Legacy Extragalactic Ultraviolet Survey. We consider procedures for the PHANGS-HST SED fitting pipeline, e.g. the choice of single stellar population models, the treatment of nebular emission and dust, and the use of fluxes versus magnitudes for the SED fitting. We report on the properties of clusters in NGC 3351 and find, on average, the clusters residing in the inner star-forming ring of NGC 3351 are young ({\textless}10 Myr) and massive (105 M⊙) while clusters in the stellar bulge are significantly older. Cluster mass function fits yield β values around -2, consistent with prior results with a tendency to be shallower at the youngest ages. Finally, we explore a Bayesian analysis with additional physically motivated priors for the distribution of ages and masses and analyse the resulting cluster distributions.},

            We present the implementation of a Bayesian formalism within the Stochastically Lighting Up Galaxies (slug) stellar population synthesis code, which is designed to investigate variations in the initial mass function (IMF) of star clusters. By comparing observed cluster photometry to large libraries of clusters simulated with a continuously varying IMF, our formalism yields the posterior probability distribution function (PDF) of the cluster mass, age and extinction, jointly with the parameters describing the IMF. We apply this formalism to a sample of star clusters from the nearby galaxy NGC 628, for which broad-band photometry in five filters is available as part of the Legacy ExtraGalactic UV Survey (LEGUS). After allowing the upper-end slope of the IMF (α3) to vary, we recover PDFs for the mass, age and extinction that are broadly consistent with what is found when assuming an invariant Kroupa IMF. However, the posterior PDF for α3 is very broad due to a strong degeneracy with the cluster mass, and it is found to be sensitive to the choice of priors, particularly on the cluster mass. We find only a modest improvement in the constraining power of α3 when adding Hα photometry from the companion Hα-LEGUS survey. Conversely, Hα photometry significantly improves the age determination, reducing the frequency of multi-modal PDFs. With the aid of mock clusters, we quantify the degeneracy between physical parameters, showing how constraints on the cluster mass that are independent of photometry can be used to pin down the IMF properties of star clusters.},

	abstract = {We use new WFC3 observations of the nearby grand-design spiral galaxy M83 to develop two independent methods for estimating the ages of young star clusters. The first method uses the physical extent and morphology of Hα emission to estimate the ages of clusters younger than τ ≈ 10 Myr. It is based on the simple premise that the gas in very young (τ{\textless} a few Myr) clusters is largely coincident with the cluster stars, is in a small, ring-like structure surrounding the stars in slightly older clusters since massive star winds and supernovae have had time to push out the natal gas (e.g., τ ≈ 5 Myr), and is in a larger ring-like bubble for still older clusters (i.e., ≈5-10 Myr). If no Hα is associated with a cluster it is generally older than ≈10 Myr. The second method is based on an observed relation between pixel-to-pixel flux variations within clusters and their ages. This method relies on the fact that the brightest individual stars in a cluster are most prominent at ages around 10 Myr, and fall below the detection limit (i.e., M V {\textless} -3.5) for ages older than about 100 Myr. Older clusters therefore have a smoother appearance and smaller pixel-to-pixel variations. The youngest clusters also have lower flux variations, hence the relationship is double valued. This degeneracy in age can be broken using other age indicators such as Hα morphology. These two methods are the basis for a new morphological classification system which can be used to estimate the ages of star clusters based on their appearance. We compare previous age estimates of clusters in M83 determined from fitting UBVIHα measurements using predictions from stellar evolutionary models with our new morphological categories and find good agreement, at the ≈95\% level. The scatter within categories is ≈0.1 dex in log τ for young clusters ({\textless}10 Myr) and ≈0.5 dex for older ({\textgreater}10 Myr) clusters. A by-product of this study is the identification of 22 "single-star" H II regions in M83, with central stars having ages ≈4 Myr.},

	abstract = {A long-standing problem when deriving the physical properties of stellar populations is the degeneracy between age, reddening, and metallicity. When a single metallicity is used for all the star clusters in a galaxy, this degeneracy can result in 'catastrophic' errors for old globular clusters. Typically, approximately 10-20 per cent of all clusters detected in spiral galaxies can have ages that are incorrect by a factor of 10 or more. In this paper, we present a pilot study for four galaxies (NGC 628, NGC 1433, NGC 1365, and NGC 3351) from the PHANGS-HST survey. We describe methods to correct the age-dating for old globular clusters, by first identifying candidates using their colours, and then reassigning ages and reddening based on a lower metallicity solution. We find that young 'Interlopers' can be identified from their Hα flux. CO (2-1) intensity or the presence of dust can also be used, but our tests show that they do not work as well. Improvements in the success fraction are possible at the ≈15 per cent level (reducing the fraction of catastrophic age-estimates from between 13 and 21 per cent, to between 3 and 8 per cent). A large fraction of the incorrectly age-dated globular clusters are systematically given ages around 100 Myr, polluting the younger populations as well. Incorrectly age-dated globular clusters significantly impact the observed cluster age distribution in NGC 628, which affects the physical interpretation of cluster disruption in this galaxy. For NGC 1365, we also demonstrate how to fix a second major age-dating problem, where very dusty young clusters with E(B - V) {\textgreater} 1.5 mag are assigned old, globular-cluster like ages. Finally, we note the discovery of a dense population of ≈300 Myr clusters around the central region of NGC 1365 and discuss how this results naturally from the dynamics in a barred galaxy.},

The law depends on only one parameter R(V) = A(V)/E(B-V). An analytic formula is given for the mean extinction law which can be used to calculate color excesses or to deredden observations.

With the successful launch and commissioning of JWST, we can now obtain high-resolution infrared imaging to probe the youngest stellar populations and dust emission on the scales of star clusters and molecular clouds ({\textasciitilde}5-50 pc). In Cycle 1, PHANGS is conducting an eight-band imaging survey from 2 to 21 μm of 19 nearby spiral galaxies. Optical integral field spectroscopy, CO(2-1) mapping, and UV-optical imaging for all 19 galaxies have been obtained through large programs with ALMA, VLT-MUSE, and Hubble. PHANGS-JWST enables a full inventory of star formation, accurate measurement of the mass and age of star clusters, identification of the youngest embedded stellar populations, and characterization of the physical state of small dust grains. When combined with Hubble catalogs of {\textasciitilde}10,000 star clusters, MUSE spectroscopic mapping of {\textasciitilde}20,000 H II regions, and {\textasciitilde}12,000 ALMA-identified molecular clouds, it becomes possible to measure the timescales and efficiencies of the earliest phases of star formation and feedback, build an empirical model of the dependence of small dust grain properties on local ISM conditions, and test our understanding of how dust-reprocessed starlight traces star formation activity, all across a diversity of galactic environments. Here we describe the PHANGS-JWST Treasury survey, present the remarkable imaging obtained in the first few months of science operations, and provide context for the initial results presented in the first series of PHANGS-JWST publications.},

Several examples exist in the Milky Way Galaxy and the Local Group, but they are particularly abundant in starburst and interacting galaxies. The few YMCs that are close enough to resolve are of prime interest for studying the stellar mass function and the ecological interplay between stellar evolution and stellar dynamics. The distant unresolved clusters may be effectively used to study the star-cluster mass function, and they provide excellent constraints on the formation mechanisms of young cluster populations. YMCs are expected to be the nurseries for many unusual objects, including a wide range of exotic stars and binaries. So far only a few such objects have been found in YMCs, although their older cousins, the globular clusters, are unusually rich in stellar exotica. In this review, we focus on star clusters younger than ∼100 Myr, more than a few current crossing times old, and more massive than ∼104M⊙; the size of the cluster and its environment are considered less relevant as distinguishing parameters. We describe the global properties of the currently known young massive star clusters in the Local Group and beyond, and discuss the state of the art in observations and dynamical modeling of these systems. In order to make this review readable by observers, theorists, and computational astrophysicists, we also review the cross-disciplinary terminology.},

	abstract = {Context. Using MegaCam at the CFHT, we obtained a deep narrow band Hα+[NII] wide-field image of NGC 4569 (M90), the brightest late-type galaxy in the Virgo cluster. The image reveals the presence of long tails of diffuse ionized gas, without any associated stellar component extending from the disc of the galaxy up to ≃80 kpc (projected distance) and with a typical surface brightness of a few 10-18 erg s-1 cm-2 arcsec-2. These features provide direct evidence that NGC 4569 is undergoing a ram-presure stripping event. The image also shows a prominent 8 kpc spur of ionized gas that is associated with the nucleus that spectroscopic data identify as an outflow. With some assumptions on the 3D distribution of the gas, we use the Hα surface brightness of these extended low-surface brightness features to derive the density and the mass of the gas that has been stripped during the interaction of the galaxy with the intracluster medium. The comparison with ad hoc chemo-spectrophotometric models of galaxy evolution indicates that the mass of the Hα emitting gas in the tail is a large fraction of that of the cold phase that has been stripped from the disc, suggesting that the gas is ionized within the tail during the stripping process. The lack of star-forming regions suggests that mechanisms other than photoionization are responsible for the excitation of the gas (shocks, heat conduction, magneto hydrodynamic waves). This analysis indicates that ram pressure stripping is efficient in massive (Mstar ≃ 1010.5 M⊙) galaxies located in intermediate-mass (≃1014 M⊙) clusters under formation. It also shows that the mass of gas expelled by the nuclear outflow is only {\textasciitilde}1\% than that removed during the ram pressure stripping event.Together these results indicate that ram pressure stripping, rather than starvation through nuclear feedback, can be the dominant mechanism that is responsible for the quenching of the star formation activity of galaxies in high density environments.

We use Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFC3/UVIS and archival ACS/WFC data obtained by the Legacy Extragalactic UV Survey (LEGUS), an HST Treasury Program. We measure effective radii with GALFIT, a two-dimensional image-fitting package, and with a new technique to estimate effective radii from the concentration index of observed clusters. The distribution of effective radii from both techniques spans ∼0.5-10 pc and peaks at 2-3 pc for both galaxies. We find slight positive correlations between effective radius and cluster age in both galaxies, but no significant relationship between effective radius and galactocentric distance. Clusters in NGC 1313 display a mild increase in effective radius with cluster mass, but the trend disappears when the sample is divided into age bins. We show that the vast majority of the clusters in both galaxies are much older than their dynamical times, suggesting they are gravitationally bound objects. We find that about half of the clusters in NGC 628 are underfilling their Roche lobes, based on their Jacobi radii. Our results suggest that the young, massive clusters in NGC 628 and NGC 1313 are expanding, due to stellar mass loss or two-body relaxation, and are not significantly influenced by the tidal fields of their host galaxies.

	abstract = {We present an analysis of the stellar populations of the gas-stripped outer disks of ten Virgo cluster spiral galaxies, utilizing SparsePak integral field spectroscopy on the WIYN 3.5 m telescope and Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) UV photometry. The galaxies in our sample show evidence for being gas-stripped spiral galaxies, with star formation within a truncation radius and a passive population beyond the truncation radius. We find that all of the galaxies with spatially truncated star formation have outer-disk stellar populations consistent with star formation ending within the last 500 Myr. The synthesis of optical spectroscopy and GALEX observations demonstrate that star formation was relatively constant until the quenching time, after which the galaxies passively evolved. Large starbursts at the time of quenching are excluded for all galaxies, but there is evidence of a modest starburst in at least one galaxy. For approximately half of our galaxies, the timescales derived from our observations are consistent with galaxies being stripped in or near the cluster core, where simple ram-pressure estimates can explain the observed stripping. However, the other half of our sample galaxies were clearly stripped outside the cluster core. Such galaxies provide evidence that the intra-cluster medium is not static and smooth. For three of the most recently stripped galaxies, there are estimates for the stripping timescales from detailed gas-stripping simulations. For all three of these galaxies, our stripping timescales agree with those from the gas-stripping simulations, suggesting that star formation is quenched near the time of peak pressure. While the stripping of star-forming gas in the outer disk creates a passive population in our sample of galaxies, there is still normal star formation in the center of these galaxies. It may be that Virgo is not massive enough to completely strip these spiral galaxies and, in a more dynamically active cluster or a cluster with a higher density intracluster medium, such a process would lead to passive spirals and/or S0s.},

CO line emission traces the bulk distribution of molecular gas, which is the cold, star-forming phase of the interstellar medium. At the resolution achieved by PHANGS-ALMA, each beam reaches the size of a typical individual giant molecular cloud, so that these data can be used to measure the demographics, life cycle, and physical state of molecular clouds across the population of galaxies where the majority of stars form at z = 0. This paper describes the scientific motivation and background for the survey, sample selection, global properties of the targets, Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations, and characteristics of the delivered data and derived data products. As the ALMA sample serves as the parent sample for parallel surveys with MUSE on the Very Large Telescope, the Hubble Space Telescope, AstroSat, the Very Large Array, and other facilities, we include a detailed discussion of the sample selection. We detail the estimation of galaxy mass, size, star formation rate, CO luminosity, and other properties, compare estimates using different systems and provide best-estimate integrated measurements for each target. We also report the design and execution of the ALMA observations, which combine a Cycle 5 Large Program, a series of smaller programs, and archival observations. Finally, we present the first 1″ resolution atlas of CO emission from nearby galaxies and describe the properties and contents of the first PHANGS-ALMA public data release.},

The survey consists of 168 MUSE pointings (1' by 1' each) and a total of nearly 15 × 106 spectra, covering ∼1.5 × 106 independent spectra. PHANGS-MUSE provides the first integral field spectrograph view of star formation across different local environments (including galaxy centres, bars, and spiral arms) in external galaxies at a median resolution of 50 pc, better than the mean inter-cloud distance in the ionised interstellar medium. This `cloud-scale' resolution allows detailed demographics and characterisations of H II regions and other ionised nebulae. PHANGS-MUSE further delivers a unique view on the associated gas and stellar kinematics and provides constraints on the star-formation history. The PHANGS-MUSE survey is complemented by dedicated ALMA CO(2-1) and multi-band HST observations, therefore allowing us to probe the key stages of the star-formation process from molecular clouds to H II regions and star clusters. This paper describes the scientific motivation, sample selection, observational strategy, data reduction, and analysis process of the PHANGS-MUSE survey. We present our bespoke automated data-reduction framework, which is built on the reduction recipes provided by ESO but additionally allows for mosaicking and homogenisation of the point spread function. We further present a detailed quality assessment and a brief illustration of the potential scientific applications of the large set of PHANGS-MUSE data products generated by our data analysis framework.

	abstract = {We compare the observed turbulent pressure in molecular gas, Pturb, to the required pressure for the interstellar gas to stay in equilibrium in the gravitational potential of a galaxy, PDE. To do this, we combine arcsecond resolution CO data from PHANGS-ALMA with multiwavelength data that trace the atomic gas, stellar structure, and star formation rate (SFR) for 28 nearby star-forming galaxies. We find that Pturb correlates with - but almost always exceeds - the estimated PDE on kiloparsec scales. This indicates that the molecular gas is overpressurized relative to the large-scale environment. We show that this overpressurization can be explained by the clumpy nature of molecular gas; a revised estimate of PDE on cloud scales, which accounts for molecular gas self-gravity, external gravity, and ambient pressure, agrees well with the observed Pturb in galaxy disks. We also find that molecular gas with cloud-scale Pturb ≈ PDE ≳ 105 kB K cm-3 in our sample is more likely to be self-gravitating, whereas gas at lower pressure it appears more influenced by ambient pressure and/or external gravity. Furthermore, we show that the ratio between Pturb and the observed SFR surface density, ΣSFR, is compatible with stellar feedback-driven momentum injection in most cases, while a subset of the regions may show evidence of turbulence driven by additional sources. The correlation between ΣSFR and kpc-scale PDE in galaxy disks is consistent with the expectation from self-regulated star formation models. Finally, we confirm the empirical correlation between molecular-to-atomic gas ratio and kpc-scale PDE reported in previous works.},

We use this database to present the distributions of molecular cloud populations and subgalactic environments in 80 PHANGS galaxies, to characterize the relationship between population-averaged cloud properties and host galaxy properties, and to assess key timescales relevant to molecular cloud evolution and star formation. We show that PHANGS probes a wide range of kpc-scale gas, stellar, and star formation rate (SFR) surface densities, as well as orbital velocities and shear. The population-averaged cloud properties in each aperture correlate strongly with both local environmental properties and host galaxy global properties. Leveraging a variable selection analysis, we find that the kpc-scale surface densities of molecular gas and SFR tend to possess the most predictive power for the population-averaged cloud properties. Once their variations are controlled for, galaxy global properties contain little additional information, which implies that the apparent galaxy-to-galaxy variations in cloud populations are likely mediated by kpc-scale environmental conditions. We further estimate a suite of important timescales from our multiwavelength measurements. The cloud-scale freefall time and turbulence crossing time are {\textasciitilde}5-20 Myr, comparable to previous cloud lifetime estimates. The timescales for orbital motion, shearing, and cloud-cloud collisions are longer, {\textasciitilde}100 Myr. The molecular gas depletion time is 1-3 Gyr and shows weak to no correlations with the other timescales in our data. We publish our measurements online, and expect them to have broad utility to future studies of molecular clouds and star formation.},

	abstract = {Context. Measuring how the physical properties of galaxies change across cosmic times is essential to understand galaxy formation and evolution. With the advent of numerous ground-based and space-borne instruments launched over the past few decades we now have exquisite multi-wavelength observations of galaxies from the far-ultraviolet (FUV) to the radio domain. To tap into this mine of data and obtain new insight into the formation and evolution of galaxies, it is essential that we are able to extract information from their spectral energy distribution (SED). Aims: We present a completely new implementation of Code Investigating GALaxy Emission (CIGALE). Written in python, its main aims are to easily and efficiently model the FUV to radio spectrum of galaxies and estimate their physical properties such as star formation rate, attenuation, dust luminosity, stellar mass, and many other physical quantities. Methods: To compute the spectral models, CIGALE builds composite stellar populations from simple stellar populations combined with highly flexible star formation histories, calculates the emission from gas ionised by massive stars, and attenuates both the stars and the ionised gas with a highly flexible attenuation curve. Based on an energy balance principle, the absorbed energy is then re-emitted by the dust in the mid- and far-infrared domains while thermal and non-thermal components are also included, extending the spectrum far into the radio range. A large grid of models is then fitted to the data and the physical properties are estimated through the analysis of the likelihood distribution. Results: CIGALE is a versatile and easy-to-use tool that makes full use of the architecture of multi-core computers, building grids of millions of models and analysing samples of thousands of galaxies, both at high speed. Beyond fitting the SEDs of galaxies and parameter estimations, it can also be used as a model-generation tool or serve as a library to build new applications.

	abstract = {We study two galaxies samples selected in near-ultraviolet (NUV) and in far-infrared (FIR) for which the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from the far-UV (FUV) to the FIR are available. We compared the observed SEDs to modelled SEDs with several star formation histories (SFHs; decaying star formation rate plus burst) and dust attenuation laws (power law + 2175 Åbump). The Bayesian method allows one to estimate statistically the best parameters by comparing each observed SED to the full set of 82800 models. We reach the conclusion that the UV dust attenuation cannot be estimated correctly from SED analysis if the FIR information is not used. The dispersion is larger than with the FIR data. The distribution is also not symmetrically distributed about zero: there is an overestimation for UV-selected galaxies and an underestimation for FIR-selected galaxies. The output from the analysis process suggests that UV-selected galaxies have attenuation laws in average similar to the Large Magellanic Cloud extinction law while FIR-selected galaxies attenuation laws resemble more the Milky Way extinction law. The dispersion about the average relation in the log (Fdust/FFUV) versus FUV-NUV diagram (once the main relation with FUV - NUV accounted for) is explained by two other parameters: the slope of the attenuation law and the instantaneous birthrate parameters b0 for UV-selected galaxies and the same ones plus the strength of the bump for the FIR-selected galaxies. We propose a recipe to estimate the UV dust attenuation for UV galaxies only (that should only be used whenever the FIR information is not available because the resulting AFUV is poorly defined with an uncertainty of about 0.32): AFUV= 1.4168 (FUV-NUV)2+ 0.3298 (NUV-I)2+ 2.1207 (FUV-NUV) + 2.7465 (NUV-I) + 5.8408.},

	abstract = {Aims: Photometric data of galaxies covering the rest-frame wavelength range from far-UV to far-IR make it possible to derive galaxy properties with a high reliability by fitting the attenuated stellar emission and the related dust emission at the same time. Methods: For this purpose we wrote the code CIGALE (Code Investigating GALaxy Emission) that uses model spectra composed of the Maraston (or PEGASE) stellar population models, synthetic attenuation functions based on a modified Calzetti law, spectral line templates, the Dale \& Helou dust emission models, and optional spectral templates of obscured AGN. Depending on the input redshifts, filter fluxes were computed for the model set and compared to the galaxy photometry by carrying out a Bayesian-like analysis. CIGALE was tested by analysing 39 nearby galaxies selected from SINGS. The reliability of the different model parameters was evaluated by studying the resulting expectation values and their standard deviations in relation to the input model grid. Moreover, the influence of the filter set and the quality of photometric data on the code results was estimated. Results: For up to 17 filters with effective wavelengths between 0.15 and 160 μm, we find robust results for the mass, star formation rate, effective age of the stellar population at 4000 Å, bolometric luminosity, luminosity absorbed by dust, and attenuation in the far-UV. Details of the star formation history (excepting the burst fraction) and the shape of the attenuation curve are difficult to investigate with the available broad-band UV and optical photometric data. A study of the mutual relations between the reliable properties confirms the dependence of star formation activity on morphology in the local Universe and indicates a significant drop in this activity at about 1011 M⊙ towards higher total stellar masses. The dustiest galaxies in the SINGS sample are present in the same mass range. On the other hand, the far-UV attenuation of our sample galaxies does not appear to show a significant dependence on star formation activity. Conclusions: The results for our SINGS test sample demonstrate that CIGALE can be a valuable tool for studying basic properties of galaxies in the near and distant Universe if UV-to-IR data are available.},

Given the relatively small nature of existing, human-labelled star cluster samples, we transfer the knowledge of state-of-the-art neural network models for real-object recognition to classify star clusters candidates into four morphological classes. We perform a series of experiments to determine the dependence of classification performance on neural network architecture (ResNet18 and VGG19-BN), training data sets curated by either a single expert or three astronomers, and the size of the images used for training. We find that the overall classification accuracies are not significantly affected by these choices. The networks are used to classify star cluster candidates in the PHANGS-HST galaxy NGC 1559, which was not included in the training samples. The resulting prediction accuracies are 70 per cent, 40 per cent, 40-50 per cent, and 50-70 per cent for class 1, 2, 3 star clusters, and class 4 non-clusters, respectively. This performance is competitive with consistency achieved in previously published human and automated quantitative classification of star cluster candidate samples (70-80 per cent, 40-50 per cent, 40-50 per cent, and 60-70 per cent). The methods introduced herein lay the foundations to automate classification for star clusters at scale, and exhibit the need to prepare a standardized data set of human-labelled star cluster classifications, agreed upon by a full range of experts in the field, to further improve the performance of the networks introduced in this study.},

These predictions are based on a newly available library of observed stellar spectra. We also compute the spectral evolution across a larger wavelength range, from 91 Å to 160 μm, at lower resolution. The model incorporates recent progress in stellar evolution theory and an observationally motivated prescription for thermally pulsing stars on the asymptotic giant branch. The latter is supported by observations of surface brightness fluctuations in nearby stellar populations. We show that this model reproduces well the observed optical and near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams of Galactic star clusters of various ages and metallicities. Stochastic fluctuations in the numbers of stars in different evolutionary phases can account for the full range of observed integrated colours of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. The model reproduces in detail typical galaxy spectra from the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We exemplify how this type of spectral fit can constrain physical parameters such as the star formation history, metallicity and dust content of galaxies. Our model is the first to enable accurate studies of absorption-line strengths in galaxies containing stars over the full range of ages. Using the highest-quality spectra of the SDSS EDR, we show that this model can reproduce simultaneously the observed strengths of those Lick indices that do not depend strongly on element abundance ratios. The interpretation of such indices with our model should be particularly useful for constraining the star formation histories and metallicities of galaxies.},

We present results on the basis of several different catalogs of star clusters in inner and outer fields, and we conclude that different methods of selection do not strongly affect the results, particularly for clusters older than ≈10 Myr. The age distributions can be described by a power law, dN/dτvpropτγ, with γ ≈ -0.84 ± 0.12 in the inner field, and γ ≈ -0.48 ± 0.12 in the outer field for τ {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 10 Myr. We bracket the difference, Δγ, between the two fields to be in the 0.18 to 0.36 range, based on estimates of the relative star-formation histories. The mass functions can also be described by a power law, dN/dMvpropM β, with β ≈ -1.98 ± 0.14 and β ≈ -2.34 ± 0.26 in the inner and outer fields, respectively. We conclude that the shapes of the mass and age distributions of the clusters in the two fields are similar, as predicted by the quasi-universal model. Any differences between the two fields are at the ≈2σ-3σ (≈1σ-2σ) level for the age (mass) distributions. Therefore, any dependence of these distributions on the local environment is probably weak. We compare the shapes of the distributions with those predicted by two popular cluster disruption models. We find that both show evidence that the clusters are disrupted at a rate that is approximately independent of their mass.

These new observations are the deepest and highest resolution images ever taken of a grand-design spiral, particularly in the near-ultraviolet, and allow us to better differentiate compact star clusters from individual stars and to measure the luminosities of even faint clusters in the U band. We find that the luminosity function (LF) for clusters outside of the very crowded starburst nucleus can be approximated by a power law, dN/dL vprop L α, with α = -2.04 ± 0.08, down to MV ≈ -5.5. We test the sensitivity of the LF to different selection techniques, filters, binning, and aperture correction determinations, and find that none of these contribute significantly to uncertainties in α. We estimate ages and masses for the clusters by comparing their measured UBVI, Hα colors with predictions from single stellar population models. The age distribution of the clusters can be approximated by a power law, dN/dτ vprop τγ, with γ = -0.9 ± 0.2, for M {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} few × 103 M sun and τ {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 4 × 108 yr. This indicates that clusters are disrupted quickly, with ≈80\%-90\% disrupted each decade in age over this time. The mass function of clusters over the same M-τ range is a power law, dN/dM vprop M β, with β = -1.94 ± 0.16, and does not have bends or show curvature at either high or low masses. Therefore, we do not find evidence for a physical upper mass limit, MC , or for the earlier disruption of lower mass clusters when compared with higher mass clusters, i.e., mass-dependent disruption.

We present the methodology developed to extract cluster positions, verify their genuine nature, produce multiband photometry (from NUV to NIR), and derive their physical properties via spectral energy distribution fitting analyses. We use the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 628 as a test case for demonstrating the impact that LEGUS will have on our understanding of the formation and evolution of YSCs and compact stellar associations within their host galaxy. Our analysis of the cluster luminosity function from the UV to the NIR finds a steepening at the bright end and at all wavelengths suggesting a dearth of luminous clusters. The cluster mass function of NGC 628 is consistent with a power-law distribution of slopes ∼ -2 and a truncation of a few times 105 \{M\}⊙ . After their formation, YSCs and compact associations follow different evolutionary paths. YSCs survive for a longer time frame, confirming their being potentially bound systems. Associations disappear on timescales comparable to hierarchically organized star-forming regions, suggesting that they are expanding systems. We find mass-independent cluster disruption in the inner region of NGC 628, while in the outer part of the galaxy there is little or no disruption. We observe faster disruption rates for low mass (≤104 \{M\}⊙ ) clusters, suggesting that a mass-dependent component is necessary to fully describe the YSC disruption process in NGC 628.

Here, we review observations and theoretical models for the formation, evolution, and eventual disruption of star clusters. Current literature suggests a picture of this life cycle including the following several phases: Clusters form in hierarchically structured, accreting molecular clouds that convert gas into stars at a low rate per dynamical time until feedback disperses the gas. The densest parts of the hierarchy resist gas removal long enough to reach high star-formation efficiency, becoming dynamically relaxed and well mixed. These remain bound after gas removal. In the first ∼100 Myr after gas removal, clusters disperse moderately fast, through a combination of mass loss and tidal shocks by dense molecular structures in the star-forming environment. After ∼100 Myr, clusters lose mass via two-body relaxation and shocks by giant molecular clouds, processes that preferentially affect low-mass clusters and cause a turnover in the cluster mass function to appear on ∼1-10-Gyr timescales. Even after dispersal, some clusters remain coherent and thus detectable in chemical or action space for multiple galactic orbits.In the next decade, a new generation of space- and adaptive optics-assisted ground-based telescopes will enable us to test and refine this picture.},

We compile contemporary censuses of the baryons in collapsed structures and their chemical makeup and dust content. We show the following: The [Formula: see text] mass density of the Universe is well determined to redshifts [Formula: see text] and shows minor evolution with time. New observations of molecular hydrogen reveal its evolution mirrors that of the global star-formation rate density, implying a universal cosmic molecular gas depletion timescale. The low-redshift decline of the star-formation history is thus driven by the lack of molecular gas supply due to a drop in net accretion rate related to the decreased growth of dark matter halos. The metal mass density in cold gas ([Formula: see text] K) contains virtually all the metals produced by stars for [Formula: see text]. At lower redshifts, the contributors to the total amount of metals are more diverse; at [Formula: see text], most of the observed metals are bound in stars. Overall, there is little evidence for a "missing metals problem" in modern censuses. We characterize the dust content of neutral gas over cosmic time, finding the dust-to-gas and dust-to-metals ratios fall with decreasing metallicity. We calculate the cosmological dust mass density in the neutral gas up to [Formula: see text]. There is good agreement between multiple tracers of the dust content of the Universe.},

A consistent picture is emerging, whereby the star-formation rate density peaked approximately 3.5 Gyr after the Big Bang, at z≈1.9, and declined exponentially at later times, with an e-folding timescale of 3.9 Gyr. Half of the stellar mass observed today was formed before a redshift z = 1.3. About 25\% formed before the peak of the cosmic star-formation rate density, and another 25\% formed after z = 0.7. Less than ∼1\% of today's stars formed during the epoch of reionization. Under the assumption of a universal initial mass function, the global stellar mass density inferred at any epoch matches reasonably well the time integral of all the preceding star-formation activity. The comoving rates of star formation and central black hole accretion follow a similar rise and fall, offering evidence for coevolution of black holes and their host galaxies. The rise of the mean metallicity of the Universe to about 0.001 solar by z = 6, one Gyr after the Big Bang, appears to have been accompanied by the production of fewer than ten hydrogen Lyman-continuum photons per baryon, a rather tight budget for cosmological reionization.},

	abstract = {Stellar clusters are born embedded within giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and during their formation and early evolution are often only visible at infrared wavelengths, being heavily obscured by dust. Over the past 15 years advances in infrared detection capabilities have enabled the first systematic studies of embedded clusters in galactic molecular clouds. In this article we review the current state of empirical knowledge concerning these extremely young protocluster systems. From a survey of the literature we compile the first extensive catalog of galactic embedded clusters. We use the catalog to construct the mass function and estimate the birthrate for embedded clusters within 2 kpc of the sun. We find that the embedded cluster birthrate exceeds that of visible open clusters by an order of magnitude or more indicating a high infant mortality rate for protocluster systems. Less than 4-7\% of embedded clusters survive emergence from molecular clouds to become bound clusters of Pleiades age. The vast majority (90\%) of stars that form in embedded clusters form in rich clusters of 100 or more members with masses in excess of 50 M⊙. Moreover, observations of nearby cloud complexes indicate that embedded clusters account for a significant (70-90\%) fraction of all stars formed in GMCs. We review the role of embedded clusters in investigating the nature of the initial mass function (IMF) that, in one nearby example, has been measured over the entire range of stellar and substellar mass, from OB stars to substellar objects near the deuterium burning limit. We also review the role embedded clusters play in the investigation of circumstellar disk evolution and the important constraints they provide for understanding the origin of planetary systems. Finally, we discuss current ideas concerning the origin and dynamical evolution of embedded clusters and the implications for the formation of bound open clusters.},

	abstract = {Context. Although they are the main constituents of the Galactic disk population, for half of the open clusters in the Milky Way reported in the literature nothing is known except the raw position and an approximate size. Aims: The main goal of this study is to determine a full set of uniform spatial, structural, kinematic, and astrophysical parameters for as many known open clusters as possible. Methods: On the basis of stellar data from PPMXL and 2MASS, we used a dedicated data-processing pipeline to determine kinematic and photometric membership probabilities for stars in a cluster region. Results: For an input list of 3784 targets from the literature, we confirm that 3006 are real objects, the vast majority of them are open clusters, but associations and globular clusters are also present. For each confirmed object we determined the exact position of the cluster centre, the apparent size, proper motion, distance, colour excess, and age. For about 1500 clusters, these basic astrophysical parameters have been determined for the first time. For the bulk of the clusters we also derived the tidal radius. We estimated additionally average radial velocities for more than 30\% of the confirmed clusters. The present sample (called MWSC) reaches both the central parts of the Milky Way and its outer regions. It is almost complete up to 1.8 kpc from the Sun and also covers neighbouring spiral arms. However, for a small subset of the oldest open clusters (log t ≳ 9) we found some evidence of incompleteness within about 1 kpc from the Sun.

No velocity variation in nonpulsating stars is found; the implication that the incidence of binarism with separations in the range 0.3-10 AU is very much smaller than in the Population I field is clear. 'Thermal equilibrium' models of the King-Mitchie (1962, 1963) type with several components and anisotropic velocity distributions are constructed and found to represent the cluster dynamics and observed light distribution adequately. The existence of two very high-velocity objects and some difficulty with the Roche limit indicate that the thermal-equilibrium models do not describe the high-energy end of the distribution function adequately. There is no evidence for any very heavy remnants, and no mass that is not accounted for by evolution of the adopted mass function (which is steeper than that in the solar neighborhood).},

Here we leverage the extraordinary new high-resolution infrared imaging from JWST to begin the study of dust-embedded star clusters in nearby galaxies throughout the Local Volume. We present a technique for identifying dust-embedded clusters in NGC 7496 (18.7 Mpc), the first galaxy to be observed by the PHANGS-JWST Cycle 1 Treasury Survey. We select sources that have strong 3.3 μm PAH emission based on a F300M - F335M color excess and identify 67 candidate embedded clusters. Only eight of these are found in the PHANGS-HST optically selected cluster catalog, and all are young (six have SED fit ages of {\textasciitilde}1 Myr). We find that this sample of embedded cluster candidates may significantly increase the census of young clusters in NGC 7496 from the PHANGS-HST catalog; the number of clusters younger than {\textasciitilde}2 Myr could be increased by a factor of 2. Candidates are preferentially located in dust lanes and are coincident with the peaks in the PHANGS-ALMA CO (2-1) maps. We take a first look at concentration indices, luminosity functions, SEDs spanning from 2700 Å to 21 μm, and stellar masses (estimated to be between {\textasciitilde}104 and 105 M ⊙). The methods tested here provide a basis for future work to derive accurate constraints on the physical properties of embedded clusters, characterize the completeness of cluster samples, and expand analysis to all 19 galaxies in the PHANGS-JWST sample, which will enable basic unsolved problems in star formation and cluster evolution to be addressed.},

If PAHs are well mixed with the atomic and molecular gas and illuminated by the average diffuse interstellar radiation field, PAH emission may provide an approximately linear, high-resolution, high-sensitivity tracer of diffuse gas surface density. We present a pilot study that explores using PAH emission in this way based on Mid-Infrared Instrument observations of IC 5332, NGC 628, NGC 1365, and NGC 7496 from the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS-JWST Treasury. Using scaling relationships calibrated in Leroy et al., scaled F1130W provides 10-40 pc resolution and 3σ sensitivity of Σgas {\textasciitilde} 2 M ⊙ pc-2. We characterize the surface densities of structures seen at {\textless}7 M ⊙ pc-2 in our targets, where we expect the gas to be H I-dominated. We highlight the existence of filaments, interarm emission, and holes in the diffuse ISM at these low surface densities. Below {\textasciitilde}10 M ⊙ pc-2 for NGC 628, NGC 1365, and NGC 7496 the gas distribution shows a "Swiss cheese"-like topology due to holes and bubbles pervading the relatively smooth distribution of the diffuse ISM. Comparing to recent galaxy simulations, we observe similar topology for the low-surface-density gas, though with notable variations between simulations with different setups and resolution. Such a comparison of high-resolution, low-surface-density gas with simulations is not possible with existing atomic and molecular gas maps, highlighting the unique power of JWST maps of PAH emission.},

We trace the PAH fraction by combining the F770W (7.7 μm) and F1130W (11.3 μm) filters to track ionized and neutral PAH emission, respectively, and comparing the PAH emission to F2100W, which traces small, hot dust grains.

We find that H II regions traced by MUSE Hα show a systematically low PAH fraction. The PAH fraction remains relatively constant across other galactic environments, with slight variations. We use CO+HI +Hα to trace the interstellar gas phase and find that the PAH fraction decreases above a value of \$\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{I\}\}\}\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{H\}\}{\textbackslash}alpha \}/\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{{\textbackslash}Sigma \}\}\}\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{H\}\}\{{\textbackslash}rm{\textbackslash}small\{I\}\}+\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{H\}\}\}\_\{2\}\}{\textbackslash}sim \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{37.5\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{erg\}{\textbackslash},\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{s\}\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{kpc\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}{\textbackslash},\{(\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{pc\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{-2\})\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ in all four galaxies.

The photometric bands of the MIRI and NIRCam instruments on JWST provide the opportunity to measure PAH emission features across entire galaxy disks at unprecedented resolution and sensitivity. Here we present the first results of this analysis in a sample of three nearby galaxies: NGC 628, NGC 1365, and NGC 7496. Based on the variations observed in the 3.3, 7.7, and 11.3 μm features, we infer changes to the average PAH size and ionization state across the different galaxy environments. High values of F335MPAH/F1130W and low values of F1130W/F770W are measured in H II regions in all three galaxies. This suggests that these regions are populated by hotter PAHs, and/or that the PAH ionization fraction is larger. We see additional evidence of heating and/or changes in PAH size in regions with higher molecular gas content as well as increased ionization in regions with higher Hα intensity.},

	abstract = {Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) play a critical role in the reprocessing of stellar radiation and balancing the heating and cooling processes in the interstellar medium but appear to be destroyed in H II regions. However, the mechanisms driving their destruction are still not completely understood. Using PHANGS-JWST and PHANGS-MUSE observations, we investigate how the PAH fraction changes in about 1500 H II regions across four nearby star-forming galaxies (NGC 628, NGC 1365, NGC 7496, and IC 5332). We find a strong anticorrelation between the PAH fraction and the ionization parameter (the ratio between the ionizing photon flux and the hydrogen density) of H II regions. This relation becomes steeper for more luminous H II regions. The metallicity of H II regions has only a minor impact on these results in our galaxy sample. We find that the PAH fraction decreases with the Hα equivalent width-a proxy for the age of the H II regions-although this trend is much weaker than the one identified using the ionization parameter. Our results are consistent with a scenario where hydrogen-ionizing UV radiation is the dominant source of PAH destruction in star-forming regions.},

	abstract = {We present a comprehensive hybrid library of synthetic stellar spectra based on three original grids of model atmosphere spectra by [Kurucz (1995)]\{ref26\}, [Fluks et al. (1994)]\{ref19\}, and [Bessell et al. (1989, 1991)]\{ref6\}, respectively. The combined library has been intended for multiple-purpose synthetic photometry applications and was constructed according to the precepts adopted by [Buser \& Kurucz (1992)]\{ref14\}: (i) to cover the largest possible ranges in stellar parameters (Teff, log g, and [M/H]); (ii) to provide flux spectra with useful resolution on the uniform grid of wavelengths adopted by [Kurucz (1995)]\{ref26\}; and (iii) to provide synthetic broad--band colors which are highly realistic for the largest possible parameter and wavelength ranges. Because the most astrophysically relevant step consists in establishing a realistic library, the corresponding color calibration is described in some detail. Basically, for each value of the effective temperature and for each wavelength, we calculate the correction function that must be applied to a (theoretical) solar-abundance model flux spectrum in order for this to yield synthetic UBVRIJHKL colors matching the (empirical) color-temperature calibrations derived from observations. In this way, the most important systematic differences existing between the original model spectra and the observations can indeed be eliminated. On the other hand, synthetic UBV and Washington ultraviolet excesses delta\_\{(U-B)\} and delta\_\{(C-M)\} and delta\_\{(C-T1)\} obtained from the original giant and dwarf model spectra are in excellent accord with empirical metal-abundance calibrations ([Lejeune \& Buser 1996]\{ref30\}). Therefore, the calibration algorithm is designed in such a way as to preserve the original differential grid properties implied by metallicity and/or luminosity changes in the new library, if the above correction function for a solar-abundance model of a given effective temperature is also applied to models of the same temperature but different chemical compositions [M/H] and/or surface gravities log g. While the new library constitutes a first-order approximation to the program set out above, it will be allowed to develop toward the more ambitious goal of matching the full requirements imposed on a standard library. Major input for refinement and completion is expected from the extensive tests now being made in population and evolutionary synthesis studies of the integrated light of globular clusters ([Lejeune 1997]\{ref29\}) and galaxies ([Bruzual et al. 1997]\{ref10\}).},

The present calculations substantially reduce the systematic effects of the 'missing UV opacity' present in the synthetic colors computed by Bell \& Gustafsson (1978) and by VandenBerg \& Bell (1985), who employed the same models but different opacity source input. The new fluxes provide significantly improved theoretical representations of the observed two-color diagrams and the empirical temperature calibrations for F-, G-, and K-type stars of all luminosities and metallicities.

	abstract = {A reexamination of the correspondence between 6 cm radio continuum sources and young star clusters in the Antennae galaxies indicates that {\textasciitilde}85\% of the strong thermal sources have optical counterparts, once the optical image is shifted 1.2" to the southwest. A sample of 37 radio-optical matches are studied in detail, showing correlations between radio properties (i.e., total flux and spectral index) and a variety of optical characteristics (i.e., intrinsic cluster brightness, Hα flux and equivalent width, extinction, and cluster ages). There is a strong correlation between the radio flux and the intrinsic optical brightness. In particular, the brightest radio source is also the intrinsically brightest optical cluster (WS 80). It is also the most extincted cluster in the sample, the strongest CO source, and the strongest 15 micron source. Furthermore, the 10 brightest radio sources are all among the youngest clusters, with ages in the range 0-4 Myr and extinctions from AV=0.5 to 7.6 mag (with a median value of 2.6 mag). A weak correlation between age and AV suggests that {\textasciitilde}6 Myr are typically required to remove enough dust to reach AV=1 mag. The radio-bright phase lasts only about 10 Myr in these clusters, consistent with the interpretation that most of the radio emission originates from hot gas. Many of the nondetections are probably individual supernova remnants since they have relatively steep radio indices typical of nonthermal sources. Only a few of the very red clusters originally discovered by Whitmore and Schweizer are radio sources, contrary to earlier suggestions. Finally, a new hybrid method of determining cluster ages has been developed using both UBVI colors and Hα equivalent widths to break the age-reddening degeneracy. We find that the Bruzual and Charlot models, which use the Padova spectral evolution tracks, fit the data reasonably well, while the Leitherer \& Heckman models, using the Geneva tracks, have a large red loop for ages 8-13 Myr that does not agree with the data.

We find that the peak epoch of cluster formation occurred {\textasciitilde}150 Myr ago, in contrast to earlier work that found a peak formation age of 1.1 Gyr. The difference is most likely due to our inclusion of U-band data, which are essential for accurate age determinations of young cluster populations. We further show that the previously reported turnover in the cluster luminosity function is probably due to the neglect of the effect of extended sources on the detection limit. The much younger cluster ages we derive clarifies the evolution of the M82 starburst. The M82-B age distribution now overlaps with the ages of the nuclear starburst, the clusters formed on the opposite side of the disk, and the last encounter with M81, some 220 Myr ago.

We investigate the effects caused by restricting oneself to a limited number of available passbands, choices of various passband combinations, finite observational errors, non-continuous model input parameter values, and restrictions in parameter space allowed during analysis. Starting from a complete set of UBVRIJH passbands (respectively, their Hubble Space Telescope/WFPC2 equivalents) we investigate to what extent clusters with different combinations of age, metallicity, internal extinction and mass can or cannot be disentangled in the various evolutionary stages throughout their lifetimes and what are the most useful passbands required to resolve the ambiguities. We find the U and B bands to be of the highest significance, while the V band and near-infrared data provide additional constraints. A code is presented that makes use of luminosities of a star cluster system in all of the possibly available passbands, and tries to find ranges of allowed age-metallicity-extinction-mass combinations for individual members of star cluster systems. Numerous tests and examples are presented. We show the importance of good photometric accuracies and of determining the cluster parameters independently without any prior assumptions.},

A detailed analysis is performed for one cluster `M82-A1' and its immediate environment in the starburst core. From Hubble Space Telescope archive images, we find that it is elliptical with an effective radius of 3.0 +/- 0.5pc and is surrounded by a compact (r = 4.5 +/- 0.5pc) HII region. We determine the age and reddening of M82-A1 using synthetic spectra from population synthesis models by fitting both the continuum energy distribution and the depth of the Balmer jump. We find an age of 6.4 +/- 0.5Myr and a photometric mass estimate of M = 7-13 × 105 Msolar. We associate its formation with the most recent starburst event 4-6Myr ago. We find that the oxygen abundance of the HII region surrounding M82-A1 is solar or slightly higher. The HII region has a high pressure P/k = 1-2 × 107 cm-3K. The diffuse gas in region A has a slightly lower pressure, which together with the broad Hα emission-line width, suggests that both the thermal and turbulent pressures in the M82 starburst core are unusually high. We discuss how this environment has affected the evolution of the cluster wind for M82-A1. We find that the high pressure may have caused the pressure-driven bubble to stall. We also obtain spectroscopic ages for clusters B1-2 and B2-1 in the `fossil' starburst region and for the intermediate age clusters F and L. These are consistent with earlier studies and demonstrate that star formation activity, sufficiently intense to produce super star clusters, has been going on in M82 during the past Gyr, perhaps in discrete and localized episodes.},

The goals of this work are threefold. First, we quantify the W-R and O-star content for selected massive young star clusters. These results are compared with similar estimates made from optical spectroscopy available in the literature. We conclude that the He II λ4686 equivalent width is a poor diagnostic measure of the true W-R content. Second, we present the strongest known He II λ1640 emission feature in a local starburst galaxy. This feature is clearly of stellar origin in the massive cluster NGC 3125-1, as it is broadened ({\textasciitilde}1000 km s-1). Strong N IV λ1488 and N V λ1720 emission lines commonly found in the spectra of individual W-R stars of WN subtype are also observed in the spectrum of NGC 3125-1. Finally, we create empirical spectral templates to gain a basic understanding of the recently observed strong He II λ1640 feature seen in Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) at redshifts z{\textasciitilde}3. The UV field observed in local starbursts provides a good overall match to the continuum and weak photospheric features in LBGs in the spectral range λλ1300-1700 but cannot reproduce the He II λ1640 emission seen in the composite LBG sample of Shapley et al. An additional (ad hoc) 10\%-15\% contribution from ``extreme'' W-R clusters similar to NGC 3125-1 on top of the field provides a good match to the strength of this feature.

We derived Lick indices in the optical and the Ca II triplet index in the near-infrared in order to infer the clusters' stellar population properties. The inferred cluster ages are typically older than ∼9 Gyr, although ages are derived with large uncertainties. The clusters exhibit intermediate metallicities, in the range -1.2 ≲ [Fe/H] ≲ -0.7, and typically sub-solar [α/Fe] ratios, with a peak at ∼-0.4. These properties suggest that (i) during the first few Gyr NGC 4449 formed stars slowly and inefficiently, with galactic winds having possibly contributed to the expulsion of the α-elements, and (ii) globular clusters in NGC 4449 formed relatively `late', from a medium already enriched in the products of Type Ia supernovae. The majority of clusters appear also underabundant in CN compared to Milky Way halo globular clusters, perhaps because of the lack of a conspicuous N-enriched, second generation of stars like that observed in Galactic globular clusters. Using the cluster velocities, we infer the dynamical mass of NGC 4449 inside 2.88 kpc to be M({\textless}2.88 kpc) = 3.15{\textasciicircum}\{+3.16\}\_\{-0.75\} × 10{\textasciicircum}9 M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}. We also report the serendipitous discovery of a planetary nebula within one of the targeted clusters, a rather rare event.},

	abstract = {We present a new catalog and results for the cluster system of the starburst galaxy NGC 4449, based on multiband imaging observations taken as part of the LEGUS and Hα-LEGUS surveys. We improve the spectral energy fitting method used to estimate cluster ages, and find that the results, particularly for older clusters, are in better agreement with those from spectroscopy. The inclusion of Hα measurements, the role of stochasticity for low-mass clusters, the assumptions about reddening, and the choices of SSP model and metallicity all have important impacts on the age dating of clusters. A comparison with ages derived from stellar color-magnitude diagrams for partially resolved clusters shows reasonable agreement, but large scatter in some cases. The fraction of light found in clusters relative to the total light (I.e., TL) in the U, B, and V filters in 25 different ≈ kiloparsec-size regions throughout NGC 4449 correlates with both the specific region luminosity, RL, and the dominant age of the underlying stellar population in each region. The observed cluster age distribution is found to decline over time as dN/dτ ∝ τγ, with γ = -0.85 ± 0.15, independent of cluster mass, and is consistent with strong, early cluster disruption. The mass functions of the clusters can be described by a power law with dN/dM ∝ Mβ and β = -1.86 ± 0.2, independent of cluster age. The mass and age distributions are quite resilient to differences in age-dating methods. There is tentative evidence for a factor of 2-3 enhancement in both the star and cluster formation rate ≈100-300 Myr ago, indicating that cluster formation tracks star formation generally. The enhancement is probably associated with an earlier interaction event.},

This allows to extend them to significantly younger ages than before. They now cover the age range from 4 Myr all through 14 Gyr. We point out the very important contributions of gaseous emission to broad band fluxes and their strong metallicity dependence during very early evolutionary stages of star clusters, galaxies or subgalactic fragments with vigorous ongoing star formation. Emission-line contributions are commonly seen in these actively star-forming regions. Models without gaseous emission cannot explain their observed colors at all, or lead to wrong age estimates. We use up-to-date Lyman continuum (=Lyc) emission rates and decided to use recent empirical determinations of emission line ratios relative to Hbeta for subsolar metallicities. We justify this approach for all situations where no or not enough spectral information is available to determine all the parameters required by photoionization models. The effects of gaseous line and continuum emission on broad band fluxes are shown for different metallicities and as a function of age. In addition to the many filter systems already included in our earlier models, we here also include the HST NICMOS and Advanced Camera for Surveys (=ACS) filter systems.

	abstract = {The majority of clusters in the universe have masses well below 105 M ⊙. Hence, their integrated fluxes and colors can be affected by the presence or absence of a few bright stars introduced by stochastic sampling of the stellar mass function. Specific methods are being developed to extend the analysis of cluster energy distributions into the low-mass regime. In this paper, we apply such a method to real observations of star clusters, in the nearby spiral galaxy M83. We reassess the ages and masses of a sample of 1242 clusters for which UBVIHα fluxes were obtained from observations with the Wide Field Camera 3 instrument on board the Hubble Space Telescope. Synthetic clusters with known properties are used to characterize the limitations of the method (valid range and resolution in age and mass, method artifacts). The ensemble of color predictions of the discrete cluster models are in good agreement with the distribution of observed colors. We emphasize the important role of the Hα data in the assessment of the fraction of young objects, particularly in breaking the age-extinction degeneracy that hampers an analysis based on UBVI data only. We find the mass distribution of the cluster sample to follow a power law of index -2.1 ± 0.2, and the distribution of ages a power law of index -1.0 ± 0.2 for log (M/ M ⊙) {\textgreater} 3.5, and ages between 107 and 109 yr. An extension of our main method, which makes full use of the probability distributions of age and mass obtained for the individual clusters of the sample, is explored. It produces similar power-law slopes and will deserve further investigation. Although the properties derived for individual clusters significantly differ from those obtained with traditional, non-stochastic models in about 30\% of the objects, the first-order aspect of the age and mass distributions is similar to those obtained previously for this M83 sample in the range of overlap of the studies. We extend the power-law description to lower masses with better mass and age resolution and without most of the artifacts produced by the classical method.},

These optical spectroscopic maps are essential to constrain the physical properties of the H II regions, which we use to investigate their internal pressure terms. We estimate the photoionized gas (Ptherm), direct radiation (Prad), and mechanical wind pressure (Pwind), which we compare to the confining pressure of their host environment (Pde). The H II regions remain unresolved within our {\textasciitilde}50-100 pc resolution observations, so we place upper (Pmax) and lower (Pmin) limits on each of the pressures by using a minimum (i.e. clumpy structure) and maximum (i.e. smooth structure) size, respectively. We find that the Pmax measurements are broadly similar, and for Pmin the Ptherm is mildly dominant. We find that the majority of H II regions are overpressured, Ptot/Pde = (Ptherm + Pwind + Prad)/Pde {\textgreater} 1, and expanding, yet there is a small sample of compact H II regions with Ptot,max/Pde {\textless} 1 ({\textasciitilde}1 per cent of the sample). These mostly reside in galaxy centres (Rgal {\textless} 1 kpc), or, specifically, environments of high gas surface density; log(Σgas/M⊙ pc-2) {\textasciitilde} 2.5 (measured on kpc-scales). Lastly, we compare to a sample of literature measurements for Ptherm and Prad to investigate how dominant pressure term transitions over around 5 dex in spatial dynamic range and 10 dex in pressure.},

New X-ray data for NGC 1291, the object with the most prominent bulge, confirm earlier results that the ISM in the bulge is dominated by hot gas. NGC 3623 has a lesser amount of hot gas in the bulge but has both molecular gas and ionized hydrogen in the central regions. NGC 2775 has the least prominent bulge; its X-ray emission is consistent with an origin in X-ray binary stars, and there is a strict upper limit on the amount of molecular present in the bulge. All three galaxies have a ring of neutral hydrogen in the disk. NGC 3623 and NGC 2775 each have in addition a molecular ring coincident with the hydrogen ring. We conclude that even within the morphological class Sa there can be significant differences in the gas content of the bulge, with the more massive bulges being likely to contain hot, X-ray-emitting gas. We discuss the possibility that the X-ray gas is part of a cooling flow in which cool gas is produced in the nucleus.},

NGC 2777 contains a large amount of hydrogen including an H I tail extending toward the larger nearby Sa galaxy, NGC 2775. Evidence for an extension of non-thermal continuum radiation from NGC 2775 toward the companion NGC 2777 is discussed. NGC 2777 is shown to be typical of a class of galaxies that are composed predominantly of recently formed stars and that are companions to larger galaxies. It is argued, however, that star formation activity is not stimulated by gravitational or collisional encounter with the main galaxy. Evidence is discussed which suggests that these kinds of companions are formed in ejection events from older galaxies and that they are more recently created galaxies. Star formation in jets is proposed as the explanation for the strong, general correlation between nonthermal and infrared emission in galaxies.},

However, individual stars in clusters beyond the nearest neighbours of the Milky Way are unresolved, forcing analyses of star cluster demographics to rely on integrated light, a process that is fraught with uncertainty. Here infer the demographics of the cluster population in the benchmark galaxy NGC 628 using data from the Legacy Extra-galactic UV Survey (LEGUS) coupled to a novel Bayesian forward-modelling technique. Our method allows analysis of a total of 1178 clusters in the LEGUS catalogue, roughly a factor of 4 more than previous studies that required severe completeness cuts to the data. Our results indicate that the cluster mass function is truncated at \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}4\$ \$ {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, consistent with proposed relations between truncation mass and star formation surface density. We find that cluster disruption begins early, \${\textbackslash}sim 10\$ Myr after formation, but that it is relatively mild, with clusters requiring on average \$2-3\$ times their present age to disrupt; we do not find any evidence for mass dependent disruption. We also do not find convincing evidence for any radial variations in these conclusions, though we find suggestive hints that inner galaxy clusters may be more prone to disruption. Confirming or refuting these hints will require future observations to increase the sample size of outer galaxy clusters.},

Recently, evidence for a very cold dust (VCD) component has also been revealed via millimetre/submillimetre (mm/sub-mm) photometry of some galaxies. This component, despite being the most massive of the three dust components in star-forming galaxies, is by virtue of its very low temperature, faint and hard to detect together with the relatively bright emission from warmer dust. Here, we analyse the dust content of a carefully selected sample of four galaxies detected by IRAS, WISE, and South Pole Telescope (SPT), whose spectral energy distributions (SEDs) were modelled to constrain their potential cold dust content. Low-frequency radio observations using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) were carried out to segregate cold dust emission from non-thermal emission in mm/sub-mm wavebands. We also carried out AstroSat/Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) observations for some galaxies to constrain their SED at shorter wavelengths so as to enforce energy balance for the SED modelling. We constructed their SEDs across a vast wavelength range (extending from UV to radio frequencies) by assembling global photometry from GALEX FUV + NUV, UVIT, Johnson BRI, 2MASS, WISE, IRAC, IRAS, AKARI, ISO PHOT, Planck HFI, SPT, and GMRT. The SEDs were modelled with CIGALE to estimate their basic properties, in particular to constrain the masses of their total and VCD components. Although the galaxies' dust masses are dominated by warmer dust, there are hints of VCD in two of the targets, NGC 7496 and NGC 7590.},

	abstract = {Analyzing resolved stellar populations across the disk of a galaxy can provide unique insights into how that galaxy assembled its stellar mass over its lifetime. Previous work at ∼1 kpc resolution has already revealed common features in the mass buildup (e.g., inside-out growth of galaxies). However, even at approximate kpc scales, the stellar populations are blurred between the different galactic morphological structures such as spiral arms, bars and bulges. Here we present a detailed analysis of the spatially resolved star formation histories (SFHs) of 19 PHANGS-MUSE galaxies, at a spatial resolution of ∼100 pc. We show that our sample of local galaxies exhibits predominantly negative radial gradients of stellar age and metallicity, consistent with previous findings, and a radial structure that is primarily consistent with local star formation, and indicative of inside-out formation. In barred galaxies, we find flatter metallicity gradients along the semi-major axis of the bar than along the semi-minor axis, as is expected from the radial mixing of material along the bar during infall. In general, the derived assembly histories of the galaxies in our sample tell a consistent story of inside-out growth, where low-mass galaxies assembled the majority of their stellar mass later in cosmic history than high-mass galaxies (also known as "downsizing"). We also show how stellar populations of different ages exhibit different kinematics. Specifically, we find that younger stellar populations have lower velocity dispersions than older stellar populations at similar galactocentric distances, which we interpret as an imprint of the progressive dynamical heating of stellar populations as they age. Finally, we explore how the time-averaged star formation rate evolves with time, and how it varies across galactic disks. This analysis reveals a wide variation of the SFHs of galaxy centers and additionally shows that structural features become less pronounced with age.},

Here, we use HST UV-optical imaging of over 20,000 sources in 23 galaxies from the Physics at High Angular Resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS) survey to train and evaluate two new sets of models: i) distance-dependent models, based on cluster candidates binned by galaxy distance (9-12 Mpc, 14-18 Mpc, 18-24 Mpc), and ii) distance-independent models, based on the combined sample of candidates from all galaxies. We find that the overall accuracy of both sets of models is comparable to previous automated star cluster classification studies ({\textasciitilde}60-80\%) and show improvement by a factor of two in classifying asymmetric and multi-peaked clusters from PHANGS-HST. Somewhat surprisingly, while we observe a weak negative correlation between model accuracy and galactic distance, we find that training separate models for the three distance bins does not significantly improve classification accuracy. We also evaluate model accuracy as a function of cluster properties such as brightness, colour, and SED-fit age. Based on the success of these experiments, our models will provide classifications for the full set of PHANGS-HST candidate clusters (N{\textasciitilde}200,000) for public release.},

Observations with the Position Sensitive Proportional Counter (PSPC) and High Resolution Imager (HRI) instruments on board the ROSAT X-ray satellite show that three X-ray sources with luminosities (1-2)×1040 erg s-1 are clearly identified with NGC 1672. The strongest X-ray source lies at the nucleus, and the other two lie near the ends of the prominent bar, locations that are also bright in Hα and near-infrared images. The nuclear source is resolved by the HRI on about the scale of the nuclear ring, and one of the sources at the ends of the bar is also probably resolved. The X-ray spectrum of the nuclear source is quite soft, having a Raymond-Smith plasma temperature of ≈0.7 keV and little evidence for intrinsic absorption. The ROSAT band X-ray flux of the nuclear source appears to be dominated not by X-ray binary emission but rather by diffuse gas emission. While the properties of the nuclear source are generally supportive of a superbubble interpretation, its large density and emission measure stretch the limits that can be comfortably accommodated by such models. The authors do not detect direct emission from the putative Seyfert nucleus, although an alternative model for the nuclear source is thermal emission from gas that is photoionized by a hidden Seyfert nucleus. The spectra of the other two X-ray sources are harder than that of the nuclear source, and superbubble models for them have the same strengths and weaknesses.},

These galaxies appear to have roughly normal CO luminosities and extents, relative to optical properties. The existence of galaxies with unusually large ratios of molecular gas to atomic gas indicate that some process has removed the low-density atomic gas and left the denser molecular gas relatively unscathed. This conclusion is supported by the observation that the ratio of CO to H I diameters decreases away from M87. These results are consistent with a process which selectively strips low-density material, such as ram pressure stripping, thermal evaporation, or turbulent viscous stripping. The relatively large fraction of H I-deficient spirals in Virgo suggests that gas removal events have taken place over at least a cluster crossing time, or about one-billion yr. If atomic gas is removed from the inner disk, the fact that the molecular gas has not yet responded to the atomic gas removal indicates that the molecular phase in galaxies is long-lived.},

Previous studies showed they are deficient in total atomic hydrogen but not in molecular hydrogen. Here we compare the combined surface densities of H I and H2 at mid-disk radii with the Kennicutt threshold for star formation. The anemic galaxies are below the threshold, which explains their lack of prominent star formation, but they are not much different than other early-type galaxies, which also tend to be below threshold. The spiral wave amplitudes of anemic and normal galaxies were also compared, using images in B and J passbands from the OSU Bright Spiral Galaxy Survey. Anemic galaxies have normal spiral wave properties too, with the same amplitudes and radial dependencies as other galaxies of the same arm class. Because of the lack of gas, spiral waves in early-type galaxies and anemics do not have a continuous supply of stars with low velocity dispersions to maintain a marginally stable disk. As a result, they are either short lived, evolving toward lenticulars and S0 types in only a few rotations at mid-disk, or they are driven by the asymmetries associated with gas removal in the cluster environment.},

The criteria of the sample selection were: (1) RC3 morphological type ranging from Sa to Scd, (2) distance of less than 25Mpc, (3) inclination angle less than 79° (RC3), (4) flux at 100μm higher than ∼ 10Jy, and (5) spiral structure not destroyed by any interaction. The maps of CO cover most of the optical disk of the galaxies. We investigated the influence of bars on the distribution of molecular gas in spiral galaxies using these data. We confirmed that the degree of the central concentration is higher in barred spirals than in nonbarred spirals, as shown by previous studies. Furthermore, we present observational evidence that bars are efficient in driving molecular gas that lies within the bar length toward the center, while the role in bringing gas in from the outer parts of the disks is small. The transported gas accounts for about half of the molecular gas within the central region in barred spiral galaxies. We found a correlation between the degree of central concentration and the bar strength. Galaxies with stronger bars tend to have a higher central concentration. The correlation implies that stronger bars accumulate molecular gas toward the center more efficiently. These results are consistent with long-lived bars.},

The total molecular gas mass (3.1*E8 Msun) is distributed in a lopsided nuclear disk of 40 pc radius, containing 15\% of the total gas mass, and two one-arm spirals, which develop at different radii in the disk. The distribution and kinematics of molecular gas in the inner 1 kpc of NGC 4826 show the prevalence of different types of m=1 perturbations in the gas. Although dominated by rotation, the gas kinematics are perturbed by streaming motions related to the m=1 instabilities. The non-circular motions associated with the inner m=1 perturbations (lopsided instability and inner one-arm spiral) agree qualitatively with the pattern expected for a trailing wave developed outside corotation (``fast'' wave). In contrast, the streaming motions in the outer m=1 spiral are better explained by a ``slow'' wave. A paradoxical consequence is that the inner m=1 perturbations would not favour AGN feeding. An independent confirmation that the AGN is not being generously fueled at present is found in the low values of the gravitational torques exerted by the stellar potential for R{\textless}530 pc. The distribution of star formation in the disk of NGC 4826 is also strongly asymmetrical. The observed asymmetries, revealed by HST images of the inner disk, follow the scales of the various m=1 perturbations identified in the molecular gas disk. Massive star formation is still vigorous, fed by the significant molecular gas reservoir at R{\textless}700 pc. There is supporting evidence for a recent large mass inflow episode in NGC 4826. The onset of m=1 instabilities of the type observed in NGC 4826 may be a consequence of secular evolution of disks with high gas mass contents. These observations have been made in the context of the NUclei of GAlaxies (NUGA) project, aimed at the study of the different mechanisms for gas fueling of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN).

A more unusual case is that of a counter-rotating gaseous component (with some associated stellar absorption) in the inner region of the flattened elliptical NGC45505. All these cases are presumed to be signatures of violently interacting systems, which are the result of galaxy mergers or captures, as in NGC72526,7. Here we report the discovery of two counter-rotating gaseous disks in the otherwise normal early-type spiral (Sab(s)II; ref. 8) NGC4826.

	abstract = {We present an investigation of the kinematics of the stars and the ionized gas along the principal axes of the galaxy NGC 4826. This galaxy is known to contain two nested, counterrotating, gas disks of a few 10{\textasciicircum}8{\textasciicircum} M\_sun\_ each, with the inner disk extending to {\textasciitilde}1 kpc and the outer disk extending beyond. The stellar kinematics along the major axis, extending across the transition region between the two gas disks, show no hint of velocity reversal or increased velocity dispersion. The stars always rotate in the same sense as the inner gas disk, and thus it is the outer gas disk which "counterrotates." The projected circular velocities inferred from the stellar kinematics and from the H I disks agree to within {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 10 km s{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum}, supporting other evidence that the stellar and gaseous disks are coplanar to {\textless}{\textasciitilde}7{\textasciicircum}deg{\textasciicircum}. Using a detailed analysis of the stellar velocity distributions, we can limit the fraction of counterrotating stars in the outer disk to {\textless}{\textasciitilde}0.05, or {\textless}{\textasciitilde}2 x 10{\textasciicircum}8{\textasciicircum} M\_sun\_. This upper limit is comparable to the mass of detected counterrotating gas. This low mass of counterrotating material, combined with the low- velocity dispersion in the stellar disk, implies that NGC 4826 cannot be the product of a retrograde merger of galaxies, unless they differed by at least an order of magnitude in mass. The velocities of the ionized gas along the major axis are in agreement with that of the stars for R {\textless} 0.75 kpc. The subsequent transition toward apparent counterrotation of the ionized gas is spatially well resolved, extending over {\textasciitilde}0.6 kpc in radius. The kinematics of this region are not symmetric with respect to the galaxy center. On the southeast side there is a significant region in which v\_proj\_(H II) {\textless}{\textless} v\_circ\_ {\textasciitilde} 150 km s{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum}, but σ(H II){\textasciitilde}65 km s{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum}. The kinematic asymmetries cannot be explained with any stationary dynamical model, even if gas inflow or warps were invoked. The gas in this transition region shows a diffuse spatial structure, strong [NII] and [S II] emission, as well as the high-velocity dispersion. These data present us with the conundrum of explaining a galaxy in which a stellar disk, and two counterrotating H I disks, at smaller and much larger radii, appear in equilibrium and nearly coplanar, yet in which the transition region between the gas disks is not in steady state.},

Direct evidence on the value of n is found in the relative distribution, perpendicular to the galactic plane, of gas and young objects. For various values of n, computations were made of the initial luminosity function, the rate of star formation, the exchange of gas between stars and interstellar medium, the number of white dwarfs and their luminosity function, and the abundance of helium. It is concluded, from a comparison of the results with observational data, that n is around 2. The present rate of star formation, then, is five times slower than the average rate. The interstellar gas, of which the surface density on the galactic plane was taken to be 11 per square parsec, loses 1.4 O/pc2 per 10 years by the formation of stars but gains about one-third of this by ejection of gas from evolving stars. The present helium abundance of the interstellar gas may be explained if a star has burned, on the average, 53 per cent of its original hydrogen into helium at the time that ejection takes place. The ejected material was assumed to have a composition equal to the average composition of the star. The effect of star formation on the gas density in the galactic system and other galaxies is briefly discussed.},

The disk-averaged SFRs and gas densities for the combined sample are well represented by a Schmidt law with index N = 1.4 +/- 0.15. The Schmidt law provides a surprisingly tight parametrization of the global star formation law, extending over several orders of magnitude in SFR and gas density. An alternative formulation of the star formation law, in which the SFR is presumed to scale with the ratio of the gas density to the average orbital timescale, also fits the data very well. Both descriptions provide potentially useful ``recipes'' for modeling the SFR in numerical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution.},

	abstract = {This paper provides an update of our previous scaling relations between galaxy-integrated molecular gas masses, stellar masses, and star formation rates (SFRs), in the framework of the star formation main sequence (MS), with the main goal of testing for possible systematic effects. For this purpose our new study combines three independent methods of determining molecular gas masses from CO line fluxes, far-infrared dust spectral energy distributions, and ∼1 mm dust photometry, in a large sample of 1444 star-forming galaxies between z = 0 and 4. The sample covers the stellar mass range log(M */M ⊙) = 9.0-11.8, and SFRs relative to that on the MS, δMS = SFR/SFR(MS), from 10-1.3 to 102.2. Our most important finding is that all data sets, despite the different techniques and analysis methods used, follow the same scaling trends, once method-to-method zero-point offsets are minimized and uncertainties are properly taken into account. The molecular gas depletion time t depl, defined as the ratio of molecular gas mass to SFR, scales as (1 + z)-0.6 × (δMS)-0.44 and is only weakly dependent on stellar mass. The ratio of molecular to stellar mass μ gas depends on (1+z\{)\}2.5× \{(δ \{MS\})\}0.52× \{(\{M\}* )\}-0.36, which tracks the evolution of the specific SFR. The redshift dependence of μ gas requires a curvature term, as may the mass dependences of t depl and μ gas. We find no or only weak correlations of t depl and μ gas with optical size R or surface density once one removes the above scalings, but we caution that optical sizes may not be appropriate for the high gas and dust columns at high z.

	abstract = {We present a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between star formation rate surface density, ΣSFR, and gas surface density, Σgas, at sub-kpc resolution in a sample of 18 nearby galaxies. We use high-resolution H I data from The H I Nearby Galaxy Survey, CO data from HERACLES and the BIMA Survey of Nearby Galaxies, 24 μm data from the Spitzer Space Telescope, and UV data from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer. We target seven spiral galaxies and 11 late-type/dwarf galaxies and investigate how the star formation law differs between the H2 dominated centers of spiral galaxies, their H I dominated outskirts and the H I rich late-type/dwarf galaxies. We find that a Schmidt-type power law with index N = 1.0 ± 0.2 relates ΣSFR and ΣH2 across our sample of spiral galaxies, i.e., that H2 forms stars at a constant efficiency in spirals. The average molecular gas depletion time is {\textasciitilde}2 × 109 years. The range of ΣH2 over which we measure this relation is {\textasciitilde}3-50 M sun pc-2, significantly lower than in starburst environments. We find the same results when performing a pixel-by-pixel analysis, averaging in radial bins, or when varying the star formation tracer used. We interpret the linear relation and constant depletion time as evidence that stars are forming in giant molecular clouds with approximately uniform properties and that ΣH2 may be more a measure of the filling fraction of giant molecular clouds than changing conditions in the molecular gas. The relationship between total gas surface density (Σgas) and ΣSFR varies dramatically among and within spiral galaxies. Most galaxies show little or no correlation between ΣHI and ΣSFR. As a result, the star formation efficiency (SFE), ΣSFR/Σgas, varies strongly across our sample and within individual galaxies. We show that this variation is systematic and consistent with the SFE being set by local environmental factors: in spirals the SFE is a clear function of radius, while the dwarf galaxies in our sample display SFEs similar to those found in the outer optical disks of the spirals. We attribute the similarity to common environments (low density, low metallicity, H I dominated) and argue that shear (which is typically absent in dwarfs) cannot drive the SFE. In addition to a molecular Schmidt law, the other general feature of our sample is a sharp saturation of H I surface densities at ΣHI ≈ 9 M sun pc-2 in both the spiral and dwarf galaxies. In the case of the spirals, we observe gas in excess of this limit to be molecular.},

	abstract = {We measure the star formation efficiency (SFE), the star formation rate (SFR) per unit of gas, in 23 nearby galaxies and compare it with expectations from proposed star formation laws and thresholds. We use H I maps from The H I Nearby Galaxy Survey (THINGS) and derive H2 maps of CO measured by HERA CO-Line Extragalactic Survey and Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association Survey of Nearby Galaxies. We estimate the SFR by combining Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) far-ultraviolet maps and the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS) 24 μm maps, infer stellar surface density profiles from SINGS 3.6 μm data, and use kinematics from THINGS. We measure the SFE as a function of the free fall and orbital timescales, midplane gas pressure, stability of the gas disk to collapse (including the effects of stars), the ability of perturbations to grow despite shear, and the ability of a cold phase to form. In spirals, the SFE of H2 alone is nearly constant at (5.25 ± 2.5) × 10-10 yr-1 (equivalent to an H2 depletion time of 1.9 × 109 yr) as a function of all of these variables at our 800 pc resolution. Where the interstellar medium (ISM) is mostly H I, however, the SFE decreases with increasing radius in both spiral and dwarf galaxies, a decline reasonably described by an exponential with scale length 0.2r 25-0.25r 25. We interpret this decline as a strong dependence of giant molecular cloud (GMC) formation on environment. The ratio of molecular-to-atomic gas appears to be a smooth function of radius, stellar surface density, and pressure spanning from the H2-dominated to H I-dominated ISM. The radial decline in SFE is too steep to be reproduced only by increases in the free-fall time or orbital time. Thresholds for large-scale instability suggest that our disks are stable or marginally stable and do not show a clear link to the declining SFE. We suggest that ISM physics below the scales that we observe—phase balance in the H I, H2 formation and destruction, and stellar feedback—governs the formation of GMCs from H I.},

PHANGS-HST also provides parallel ACS imaging of the galaxy halos in F606W+F814W. This imaging provides an ideal sample of Population II stars from which to construct color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). From these CMDs, we identify the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB), the point in the evolution of low-mass stars just before the onset of the helium flash. It has been shown that this feature acts as a remarkably consistent standard-candle, with only small corrections required for metallicity.

	abstract = {The Legacy ExtraGalactic UV Survey (LEGUS) is a Cycle 21 Treasury program on the Hubble Space Telescope aimed at the investigation of star formation and its relation with galactic environment in nearby galaxies, from the scales of individual stars to those of ∼kiloparsec-size clustered structures. Five-band imaging from the near-ultraviolet to the I band with the Wide-Field Camera 3 (WFC3), plus parallel optical imaging with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS), is being collected for selected pointings of 50 galaxies within the local 12 Mpc. The filters used for the observations with the WFC3 are F275W(λ2704 Å), F336W(λ3355 Å), F438W(λ4325 Å), F555W(λ5308 Å), and F814W(λ8024 Å) the parallel observations with the ACS use the filters F435W(λ4328 Å), F606W(λ5921 Å), and F814W(λ8057 Å). The multiband images are yielding accurate recent (≲50 Myr) star formation histories from resolved massive stars and the extinction-corrected ages and masses of star clusters and associations. The extensive inventories of massive stars and clustered systems will be used to investigate the spatial and temporal evolution of star formation within galaxies. This will, in turn, inform theories of galaxy evolution and improve the understanding of the physical underpinning of the gas-star formation relation and the nature of star formation at high redshift. This paper describes the survey, its goals and observational strategy, and the initial scientific results. Because LEGUS will provide a reference survey and a foundation for future observations with the James Webb Space Telescope and with ALMA, a large number of data products are planned for delivery to the community.

	abstract = {We present the star cluster catalogues for 17 dwarf and irregular galaxies in the HST Treasury Program `Legacy ExtraGalactic UV Survey' (LEGUS). Cluster identification and photometry in this sub-sample are similar to that of the entire LEGUS sample, but special methods were developed to provide robust catalogues with accurate fluxes due to low cluster statistics. The colours and ages are largely consistent for two widely used aperture corrections, but a significant fraction of the clusters are more compact than the average training cluster. However, the ensemble luminosity, mass, and age distributions are consistent suggesting that the systematics between the two methods are less than the random errors. When compared with the clusters from previous dwarf galaxy samples, we find that the LEGUS catalogues are more complete and provide more accurate total fluxes. Combining all clusters into a composite dwarf galaxy, we find that the luminosity and mass functions can be described by a power law with the canonical index of -2 independent of age and global SFR binning. The age distribution declines as a power law, with an index of ≈- 0.80 ± 0.15, independent of cluster mass and global SFR binning. This decline of clusters is dominated by cluster disruption since the combined star formation histories and integrated-light SFRs are both approximately constant over the last few hundred Myr. Finally, we find little evidence for an upper-mass cut-off ({\textless}2σ) in the composite cluster mass function, and can rule out a truncation mass below ≈104.5M⊙ but cannot rule out the existence of a truncation at higher masses.},

We implement a custom pipeline specifically designed to be robust against contamination, which allows us to measure radii for 6097 clusters. This is the largest sample of young star cluster radii currently available. We find that most (but not all) galaxies share a common cluster radius distribution, with the peak at around 3 pc. We find a clear mass-radius relation of the form Reff ∝ M0.24. This relation is present at all cluster ages younger than 1 Gyr, but with a shallower slope for clusters younger than 10 Myr. We present simple toy models to interpret these age trends, finding that high-mass clusters are more likely to be not tidally limited and expand. We also find that most clusters in LEGUS are gravitationally bound, especially at older ages or higher masses. Lastly, we present the cluster density and surface density distributions, finding a large scatter that appears to decrease with cluster age. The youngest clusters have a typical surface density of 100\${\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{ M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{pc\}{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$.},

	abstract = {Evolutionary population synthesis models for a wide range of metallicities, ages, star formation histories, initial mass functions and horizontal branch morphologies, including blue morphologies at high metallicity, are computed. The model output comprises spectral energy distributions, colours, stellar M/L ratios, bolometric corrections and near-infrared (IR) spectral line indices. The energetics of the post main sequence evolutionary phases are evaluated with the fuel consumption theorem. The impact on the models of the stellar evolutionary tracks (in particular with and without overshooting) is assessed. We find modest differences in synthetic broad-band colours as induced by the use of different tracks in our code [e.g. Δ(V-K) {\textasciitilde} 0.08 mag, Δ(B-V) {\textasciitilde} 0.03 mag]. Noticeably, these differences are substantially smaller than the scatter among other models in the literature, even when the latter adopt the same evolutionary tracks. The models are calibrated with globular cluster data from the Milky Way for old ages, and the Magellanic clouds plus the merger remnant galaxy NGC 7252, both for young ages of {\textasciitilde}0.1-2Gyr, in a large wavelength range from the U band to the K band. Particular emphasis is put on the contribution from the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) phase. We show that this evolutionary phase is crucial for the modelling of young stellar populations by direct comparison with observed spectral energy distributions of Magellanic cloud clusters, which are characterized by relatively high fluxes, both blueward and redward of the V band. We find that the combination of the near-IR spectral indices C2 and H2O can be used to determine the metallicity of {\textasciitilde}1 Gyr stellar populations. As an illustrative application, we re-analyse the spectral energy distributions of some of the high-z galaxies (2.4 {\textless}{\textasciitilde}z{\textless}{\textasciitilde} 2.9) observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope by Yan et al. Their high rest-frame near-IR fluxes is reproduced very well with the models including TP-AGB stars for ages in the range {\textasciitilde}0.6-1.5Gyr, suggesting formation redshifts for these objects around z{\textasciitilde} 3-6.},

	abstract = {Connecting the gas in H II regions to the underlying source of the ionizing radiation can help us constrain the physical processes of stellar feedback and how H II regions evolve over time. With PHANGS-MUSE, we detect nearly 24 000 H II regions across 19 galaxies and measure the physical properties of the ionized gas (e.g. metallicity, ionization parameter, and density). We use catalogues of multiscale stellar associations from PHANGS-HST to obtain constraints on the age of the ionizing sources. We construct a matched catalogue of 4177 H II regions that are clearly linked to a single ionizing association. A weak anticorrelation is observed between the association ages and the \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{H\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}alpha\$ equivalent width \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{EW\}({\textbackslash}mathrm\{H\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}alpha)\$, the \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{H\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}alpha/{\textbackslash}mathrm\{FUV\}\$ flux ratio, and the ionization parameter, log q. As all three are expected to decrease as the stellar population ages, this could indicate that we observe an evolutionary sequence. This interpretation is further supported by correlations between all three properties. Interpreting these as evolutionary tracers, we find younger nebulae to be more attenuated by dust and closer to giant molecular clouds, in line with recent models of feedback-regulated star formation. We also observe strong correlations with the local metallicity variations and all three proposed age tracers, suggestive of star formation preferentially occurring in locations of locally enhanced metallicity. Overall, \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{EW\}({\textbackslash}mathrm\{H\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}alpha)\$ and log q show the most consistent trends and appear to be most reliable tracers for the age of an H II region.},

	abstract = {We investigate the ionised gas morphology, excitation properties, and kinematics in 19 nearby star-forming galaxies from the PHANGS-MUSE survey. We directly compare the kinetic energy of expanding superbubbles and the turbulent motions in the interstellar medium with the mechanical energy deposited by massive stars in the form of winds and supernovae, with the aim to answer whether the stellar feedback is responsible for the observed turbulent motions and to quantify the fraction of mechanical energy retained in the superbubbles. Based on the distribution of the flux and velocity dispersion in the H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ line, we select 1484 regions of locally elevated velocity dispersion (\${\textbackslash}sigma\$(H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$){\textgreater}45 km/s), including at least 171 expanding superbubbles. We analyse these regions and relate their properties to those of the young stellar associations and star clusters identified in PHANGS-HST data. We find a good correlation between the kinetic energy of the ionised gas and the total mechanical energy input from supernovae and stellar winds from the stellar associations, with a typical coupling efficiency of 10-20\%. The contribution of mechanical energy by the supernovae alone is not sufficient to explain the measured kinetic energy of the ionised gas, which implies that pre-supernova feedback in the form of radiation/thermal pressure and winds is necessary. We find that the gas kinetic energy decreases with metallicity for our sample covering Z=0.5-1.0 Zsun, reflecting the lower impact of stellar feedback. For the sample of superbubbles, we find that about 40\% of the young stellar associations are preferentially located in their rims. We also find a slightly higher (by {\textasciitilde}15\%) fraction of the youngest ({\textless}3 Myr) stellar associations in the rims of the superbubbles than in the centres, and the opposite for older associations, which implies possible propagation or triggering of star formation.},

	abstract = {Context. Star formation and stellar feedback are interlinked processes that redistribute energy, turbulence, and material throughout galaxies. Because young and massive stars form in spatially clustered environments, they create pockets of expanding gas termed superbubbles, which retain information about the physical processes that drive them. As these processes play a critical role in shaping galaxy discs and regulating the baryon cycle, measuring the properties of superbubbles provides important input for galaxy evolution models. Aims: With the wide coverage and high angular resolution (∼50-150 pc) of the PHANGS-ALMA 12CO (J = 2−1) survey, we can now resolve, identify and characterise a statistically representative number of superbubbles using molecular gas in nearby galaxies. Methods: We identify superbubbles by requiring spatial correspondence between shells in CO with stellar populations identified in PHANGS-HST. Then, by combining the properties of the stellar populations with the CO, we quantify the energetics of the stars and constrain feedback models. We visually find 325 cavities across 18 PHANGS-ALMA galaxies, 88 of which have clear superbubble signatures (unbroken shells, central clusters, kinematic signatures of expansion). We measure their radii and expansion velocities using CO (2-1) to dynamically derive their ages and the mechanical power driving the bubbles, which we use to compute the expected properties of the parent stellar populations driving the bubbles. Results: We find consistency between the predicted and derived stellar ages and masses of the stellar populations if we use a supernova (SN) model that injects energy with a coupling efficiency of ∼10\%. Not only does this confirm that molecular gas accurately traces superbubble properties, but it also provides key observational constraints for superbubble models. We also find evidence that the bubbles are sweeping up gas as they expand, and speculate that these sites have the potential to host new generations of stars. Conclusions: This work demonstrates that molecular superbubbles provide novel quantitative constraints on SNe feedback efficiencies and gas clearing times, and represent a promising environment to search for the propagation of star formation, all of which are needed to understand what sets the observed star formation rates in galaxies.

Compact sources detected in at least four bands were classified by both human experts and the convolutional neural network STARCNET. Human experts classified the 2351 brightest sources, retrieving N c = 965 star clusters. STARCNET, trained on LEGUS data not including M101, classified all 4725 sources detected in four bands, retrieving N c = 2270 star clusters. The combined catalog represents the most complete census to date of compact star clusters in M101. We find that for the 2351 sources with both a visual- and machine-learning classification STARCNET is able to reproduce the human classifications at high levels of accuracy ({\textasciitilde}80\%-90\%), which is equivalent to the level of agreement between human classifiers in LEGUS. The derived cluster age distribution implies a disruption rate of \$\{dN\}/d{\textbackslash}tau {\textbackslash}propto \{{\textbackslash}tau \}{\textasciicircum}\{-0.45{\textbackslash}pm 0.14\}\$ over 107 {\textless} τ {\textless} 108.5 yr for cluster masses ≥103.55 M ⊙ for the central region of M101 and \$\{dN\}/d{\textbackslash}tau {\textbackslash}propto \{{\textbackslash}tau \}{\textasciicircum}\{-0.02{\textbackslash}pm 0.15\}\$ for cluster masses ≥103.38 M ⊙ in the northwest region of the galaxy.

STARCNET (STAR Cluster classification NETwork) is a multiscale convolutional neural network (CNN) that achieves an accuracy of 68.6\% (four classes)/86.0\% (two classes: cluster/noncluster) for star cluster classification in the images of the LEGUS galaxies, nearly matching human expert performance. We test the performance of STARCNET by applying a pre-trained CNN model to galaxies not included in the training set, finding accuracies similar to the reference one. We test the effect of STARCNET predictions on the inferred cluster properties by comparing multicolor luminosity functions and mass-age plots from catalogs produced by STARCNET and by human labeling; distributions in luminosity, color, and physical characteristics of star clusters are similar for the human and ML classified samples. There are two advantages to the ML approach: (1) reproducibility of the classifications: the ML algorithm's biases are fixed and can be measured for subsequent analysis; and (2) speed of classification: the algorithm requires minutes for tasks that humans require weeks to months to perform. By achieving comparable accuracy to human classifiers, STARCNET will enable extending classifications to a larger number of candidate samples than currently available, thus increasing significantly the statistics for cluster studies. * Based on observations obtained with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

We classify 3757 star clusters in 16 nearby galaxies according to their H α morphology (concentrated, partially exposed, no emission), using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging from the Legacy ExtraGalactic Ultraviolet Survey (LEGUS). We find: (1) The mean SED ages of clusters with concentrated (1-2 Myr) and partially exposed H II region morphologies (2-3 Myr) indicate a relatively early onset of gas clearing and a short (1-2 Myr) clearing time-scale. (2) The reddening of clusters can be overestimated due to the presence of red supergiants, which is a result of stochastic sampling of the IMF in low mass clusters. (3) The age-reddening degeneracy impacts the results of the SED fitting - out of 1408 clusters with M* ≥ 5000 M⊙, we find that at least 46 (3 per cent) have SED ages which appear significantly underestimated or overestimated based on H α and their environment, while the total percentage of poor age estimates is expected to be several times larger. (4) Lastly, we examine the dependence of the morphological classifications on spatial resolution. At HST resolution, our conclusions are robust to the distance range spanned by the sample (3-10 Mpc). However, analysis of ground-based H α images shows that compact and partially exposed morphologies frequently cannot be distinguished from each other.},

We study ∼700 young clusters (≤10 Myr) in three nearby spiral galaxies (NGC 7793, NGC 4395, and NGC 1313) using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging from LEGUS (Legacy ExtraGalactic Ultraviolet Survey). Clusters are classified by their H α morphology (concentrated, partially exposed, no-emission) and whether they have neighbouring clusters (which could affect the clearing time-scales). Through visual inspection of the HST images, and analysis of ages, reddenings, and stellar masses from spectral energy distributions fitting, together with the (U- B), (V - I) colours, we find (1) the median ages indicate a progression from concentrated (∼3 Myr), to partially exposed (∼4 Myr), to no H α emission ({\textgreater}5 Myr), consistent with the expected temporal evolution of H II regions and previous results. However, (2) similarities in the age distributions for clusters with concentrated and partially exposed H α morphologies imply a short time-scale for gas clearing (≲1 Myr). Also, (3) our cluster sample's median mass is ∼1000 M⊙, and a significant fraction (∼ 20\{\{ per cent\}\}) contain one or more bright red sources (presumably supergiants), which can mimic reddening effects. Finally, (4) the median E(B - V) values for clusters with concentrated H α and those without H α emission appear to be more similar than expected (∼0.18 versus ∼0.14, respectively), but when accounting for stochastic effects, clusters without H α emission are less reddened. To mitigate stochastic effects, we experiment with synthesizing more massive clusters by stacking fluxes of clusters within each H α morphological class. Composite isolated clusters also reveal a colour and age progression for H α morphological classes, consistent with analysis of the individual clusters.},

A currently unanswered question in this field is how long these massive clusters remain embedded in their natal gas, with important implications for the formation of multiple populations that have been used to explain phenomena observed in globular clusters. We present an analysis of ages and masses of the young massive cluster population of M83. Through visual inspection of the clusters, and comparison of their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and position in colour-colour space, the clusters are all exposed (no longer embedded) by {\textless}4 Myr, most likely less, indicating that current proposed age spreads within older clusters are unlikely. We also present several methods of constraining the ages of very young massive clusters. This can often be difficult using SED fitting due to a lack of information to disentangle age-extinction degeneracies and possible inaccurate assumptions in the models used for the fitting. The individual morphology of the Hα around each cluster has a significant effect on the measured fluxes, which contributes to inaccuracies in the age estimates for clusters younger than 10 Myr using SED fitting. This is due to model uncertainties and aperture effects. Our methods to help constrain ages of young clusters include using the near-infrared and spectral features, such as Wolf-Rayet stars.},

Our newly extracted source catalogue contains 2834 cluster candidates, morphologically classified to be compact and uniform in colour, for which ages, masses and extinction are derived. In this first work we study the main properties of the YSC population of the whole galaxy, considering a mass-limited sample. Both luminosity and mass functions follow a power-law shape with slope -2, but at high luminosities and masses a dearth of sources is observed. The analysis of the mass function suggests that it is best fitted by a Schechter function with slope -2 and a truncation mass at 1.00 ± 0.12 × 105 M⊙. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we confirm this result and link the shape of the luminosity function to the presence of a truncation in the mass function. A mass limited age function analysis, between 10 and 200 Myr, suggests that the cluster population is undergoing only moderate disruption. We observe little variation in the shape of the mass function at masses above 1 × 104 M⊙ over this age range. The fraction of star formation happening in the form of bound clusters in M51 is ∼ 20 per cent in the age range 10-100 Myr and little variation is observed over the whole range from 1 to 200 Myr.},

Through integrated broadband photometry we have derived ages, masses, and extinctions for a total of 1027 star clusters in galaxies with d L {\textless} 110 Mpc in order to avoid issues related to cluster bending. The measured cluster age distribution slope of \$\{dN\}/d{\textbackslash}tau {\textbackslash}propto \{{\textbackslash}tau \}{\textasciicircum}\{-0.5+/-0.12\}\$ is steeper than what has been observed in lower-luminosity star-forming galaxies. Further, differences in the slope of the observed cluster age distribution between inner- ( \$\{dN\}/d{\textbackslash}tau {\textbackslash}propto \{{\textbackslash}tau \}{\textasciicircum}\{-1.07+/-0.12\}\$ ) and outer-disk ( \$\{dN\}/d{\textbackslash}tau {\textbackslash}propto \{{\textbackslash}tau \}{\textasciicircum}\{-0.37+/-0.09\}\$ ) star clusters provide evidence of mass-dependent cluster destruction in the central regions of LIRGs driven primarily by the combined effect of strong tidal shocks and encounters with massive giant molecular clouds. Excluding the nuclear ring surrounding the Seyfert 1 nucleus in NGC 7469, the derived cluster mass function (CMF; \$\{dN\}/\{dM\}{\textbackslash}propto \{M\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}alpha \}\$ ) offers marginal evidence for a truncation in the power law at M t {\textasciitilde} 2×106 M ⊙ for our three most cluster-rich sources, which are all classified as early stage mergers. Finally, we find evidence of a flattening of the CMF slope of \$\{dN\}/\{dM\}{\textbackslash}propto \{M\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1.42{\textbackslash}pm 0.1\}\$ for clusters in late-stage mergers relative to early stage (α = -1.65 ± 0.02), which we attribute to an increase in the formation of massive clusters over the course of the interaction.},

	abstract = {Context. Stellar feedback is one of the fundamental factors regulating the evolution of galaxies. However, we still do not have access to strong observational constraints on the relative importance of the different feedback mechanisms (e.g. radiation, ionised gas pressure, stellar winds) in driving H II region evolution and molecular cloud disruption. To quantify and compare the different feedback mechanisms, the size of an H II region is crucial, whereas samples of well-resolved H II regions are scarce. Aims: We constrain the relative importance of the various feedback mechanisms from young massive star populations by resolving H II regions across the disk of the nearby star-forming galaxy NGC 1672. Methods: We combined measurements of ionised gas nebular lines obtained by PHANGS-MUSE, with high-resolution (PSF FWHM ∼ 0.1″; ∼10 pc) imaging from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in both the narrow-band Hα and broad-band (NUV, U, B, V, I) filters. We identified a sample of 40 isolated, compact H II regions in the HST Hα image. We measured the sizes of these H II regions, which were previously unresolved in seeing-limited ground-based observations. In addition, we identified the ionisation source(s) for each H II region from catalogues produced as part of the PHANGS-HST survey. In doing so, we were able to link young stellar populations with the properties of their surrounding H II regions. Results: The HST observations allowed us to resolve all 40 regions, with radii between 5 and 40 pc. The H II regions investigated here are mildly dominated by thermal or wind pressure, yet their elevation above the radiation pressure is within the expected uncertainty range. We see that radiation pressure provides a substantially higher contribution to the total pressure than previously found in the literature over similar size scales. In general, we find higher pressures within more compact H II regions, which is driven by the inherent size scaling relations of each pressure term, albeit with significant scatter introduced by the variation in the stellar population properties (e.g. luminosity, mass, age, metallicity). Conclusions: For nearby galaxies, the combination of MUSE/VLT observations with stellar population and resolved Hα observations from HST provides a promising approach that could yield the statistics required to map out how the importance of different stellar feedback mechanisms evolve over the lifetime of a H II region.},

Using Hubble Space Telescope broadband WFC3/UVIS UV and optical images from the Treasury Program LEGUS (Legacy ExtraGalactic UV Survey), we have identified 1392 potential young (≲ 100 Myr) stellar clusters within the galaxy using a combination of visual inspection and automatic selection. We investigate the clustering of these young stellar clusters and quantify the strength and change of clustering strength with scale using the two-point correlation function. We also investigate how image boundary conditions and dust lanes affect the observed clustering. The distribution of the clusters is well fit by a broken power law with negative exponent α. We recover a weighted mean index of α ∼ -0.8 for all spatial scales below the break at 3.″3 (158 pc at a distance of 9.9 Mpc) and an index of α ∼ -0.18 above 158 pc for the accumulation of all cluster types. The strength of the clustering increases with decreasing age and clusters older than 40 Myr lose their clustered structure very rapidly and tend to be randomly distributed in this galaxy, whereas the mass of the star cluster has little effect on the clustering strength. This is consistent with results from other studies that the morphological hierarchy in stellar clustering resembles the same hierarchy as the turbulent interstellar medium.},

	abstract = {Large-scale bars can fuel galaxy centers with molecular gas, often leading to the development of dense ringlike structures where intense star formation occurs, forming a very different environment compared to galactic disks. We pair {\textasciitilde}0.″3 (30 pc) resolution new JWST/MIRI imaging with archival ALMA CO(2-1) mapping of the central {\textasciitilde}5 kpc of the nearby barred spiral galaxy NGC 1365 to investigate the physical mechanisms responsible for this extreme star formation. The molecular gas morphology is resolved into two well-known bright bar lanes that surround a smooth dynamically cold gas disk (R gal {\textasciitilde} 475 pc) reminiscent of non-star-forming disks in early-type galaxies and likely fed by gas inflow triggered by stellar feedback in the lanes. The lanes host a large number of JWST-identified massive young star clusters. We find some evidence for temporal star formation evolution along the ring. The complex kinematics in the gas lanes reveal strong streaming motions and may be consistent with convergence of gas streamlines expected there. Indeed, the extreme line widths are found to be the result of inter-"cloud" motion between gas peaks; SCOUSEPY decomposition reveals multiple components with line widths of {\textless}σ CO,scouse{\textgreater} ≈ 19 km s-1 and surface densities of \${\textbackslash}langle {\textbackslash},\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{{\textbackslash}Sigma \}\}\}\_\{\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{H\}\}\}\_\{2\},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{scouse\}\}{\textbackslash}rangle {\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}approx {\textbackslash},800{\textbackslash},\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{pc\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ , similar to the properties observed throughout the rest of the central molecular gas structure. Tailored hydrodynamical simulations exhibit many of the observed properties and imply that the observed structures are transient and highly time-variable. From our study of NGC 1365, we conclude that it is predominantly the high gas inflow triggered by the bar that is setting the star formation in its CMZ.},

	abstract = {Galactic bars can drive cold gas inflows towards the centres of galaxies. The gas transport happens primarily through the so-called bar dust lanes, which connect the galactic disc at kpc scales to the nuclear rings at hundreds of pc scales much like two gigantic galactic rivers. Once in the ring, the gas can fuel star formation activity, galactic outflows, and central supermassive black holes. Measuring the mass inflow rates is therefore important to understanding the mass/energy budget and evolution of galactic nuclei. In this work, we use CO datacubes from the PHANGS-ALMA survey and a simple geometrical method to measure the bar-driven mass inflow rate on to the nuclear ring of the barred galaxy NGC 1097. The method assumes that the gas velocity in the bar lanes is parallel to the lanes in the frame co-rotating with the bar, and allows one to derive the inflow rates from sufficiently sensitive and resolved position-position-velocity diagrams if the bar pattern speed and galaxy orientations are known. We find an inflow rate of \${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}=(3.0 {\textbackslash}pm 2.1){\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm M\_{\textbackslash}odot {\textbackslash}, yr{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ averaged over a time span of 40 Myr, which varies by a factor of a few over time-scales of {\textasciitilde}10 Myr. Most of the inflow appears to be consumed by star formation in the ring, which is currently occurring at a star formation rate (SFR) of \${\textbackslash}simeq{\textbackslash}!1.8{\textbackslash}!-{\textbackslash}!2 {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm M\_{\textbackslash}odot {\textbackslash}, yr{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, suggesting that the inflow is causally controlling the SFR in the ring as a function of time.},

	abstract = {I study the flow of gas in and around the bars or ovals of model barred galaxies and show that it is intimately linked to the properties of the periodic orbits. Simulations show that the density of the gas in and around the bar region is low, except for the centre and two narrow lanes which are the loci of shocks. Such shocks form if the x\_1\_ periodic orbits have either loops or large curvature values at their apocentres. The form of the shock loci depends on a number of parameters characterizing the bar and disc potentials. In order for shocks to be offset from the bar major axis towards its leading side, the x\_2\_ and x\_3\_ families must not only exist but also cover a sufficient extent along the bar major axis. The shapes of the shock loci are then understood by the gradual shift of the orientation of the flow lines from that of the x\_1\_ orbits to that of x\_2\_. Along the shock there is also substantial shear, opposing star formation. The existence of offset shock loci of the observed shape puts strict constraints on the values the various model parameters may take. This should be most useful for deriving bar parameters for observed galaxies. For example, the Lagrangian radius has to lie in the interval (1.2+/-0.2) a, where a is the length of the bar semimajor axis. For low values of the bar axial ratio or the bar quadrupole moment the shock loci are curved, with their concave sides towards the bar major axis. Substantial inflow is found in models with strong shocks.},

The observed motions are consistent with material within the bar streaming along highly elongated orbits aligned with the rotating major axis. A barred galaxy may also contain a spheroidal bulge at its centre, spirals in the outer disc and, less commonly, other features such as a ring or lens.

This cloud has properties consistant with those required to form a globular cluster. We have obtained ALMA CO and 870 μm observations of the Antennae galaxy system with ∼0.″5 resolution. This cloud stands out in the data with a radius of ≲24 pc and mass of {\textgreater}5 × 106 M⊙. The cloud appears capable of forming a globular cluster, but the lack of associated thermal radio emission indicates that star formation has not yet altered the environment. The lack of thermal radio emission places the cloud in an early stage of evolution, which we expect to be short-lived (≲1 Myr) and thus rare. Given its mass and kinetic energy, for the cloud to be confined (as its appearance strongly suggests) it must be subject to an external pressure of P/kB ≳ 108 K cm-3-10,000 times higher than typical interstellar pressure. This would support theories that high pressures are required to form globular clusters and may explain why extreme environments like the Antennae are preferred environments for generating such objects. Given the cloud temperature of ∼25 K, the internal pressure must be dominated by non-thermal processes, most likely turbulence. We expect the molecular cloud to collapse and begin star formation in ≲1 Myr.},

We use the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to image the 93 GHz (3.2 mm) free-free continuum and hydrogen recombination line emission (H40α and H42α) at 2.2 pc (0"12) resolution. Our observations reveal 27 bright, compact sources with FWHM sizes of 1.4-4.0 pc, which we identify as candidate super star clusters. Recombination line emission, tracing the ionizing photon rate of the candidate clusters, is detected in 15 sources, six of which have a significant synchrotron component to the 93 GHz continuum. Adopting an age of ∼5 Myr, the stellar masses implied by the ionizing photon luminosities are \$\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{log\}\}\_\{10\}\$ (M⋆/M⊙) ≈ 4.7-6.1. We fit a slope to the cluster mass distribution and find β = -1.8 ± 0.4. The gas masses associated with these clusters, derived from the dust continuum at 350 GHz, are typically an order of magnitude lower than the stellar mass. These candidate clusters appear to have already converted a large fraction of their dense natal material into stars and, given their small freefall times of ∼0.05 Myr, are surviving an early volatile phase. We identify a pointlike source in 93 GHz continuum emission that is presumed to be the AGN. We do not detect recombination line emission from the AGN and place an upper limit on the ionizing photons that leak into the starburst region of Q0 {\textless} 1052 s-1.},

	abstract = {The center of the nearby galaxy NGC 253 hosts a population of more than a dozen super star clusters (SSCs) that are still in the process of forming. The majority of the star formation of the burst is concentrated in these SSCs, and the starburst is powering a multiphase outflow from the galaxy. In this work, we measure the 350 GHz dust continuum emission toward the center of NGC 253 at 47 mas (0.8 pc) resolution using data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. We report the detection of 350 GHz (dust) continuum emission in the outflow for the first time, associated with the prominent South-West streamer. In this feature, the dust emission has a width of ≈8 pc, is located at the outer edge of the CO emission, and corresponds to a molecular gas mass of {\textasciitilde}(8-17)×106 M ⊙. In the starburst nucleus, we measure the resolved radial profiles, sizes, and molecular gas masses of the SSCs. Compared to previous work at the somewhat lower spatial resolution, the SSCs here break apart into smaller substructures with radii 0.4-0.7 pc. In projection, the SSCs, dust, and dense molecular gas appear to be arranged as a thin, almost linear, structure roughly 155 pc in length. The morphology and kinematics of this structure can be well explained as gas following x 2 orbits at the center of a barred potential. We constrain the morpho-kinematic arrangement of the SSCs themselves, finding that an elliptical, angular-momentum-conserving ring is a good description of both the morphology and kinematics of the SSCs.},

	abstract = {Young massive clusters play an important role in the evolution of their host galaxies, and feedback from the high-mass stars in these clusters can have profound effects on the surrounding interstellar medium. The nuclear starburst in the nearby galaxy NGC 253 at a distance of 3.5 Mpc is a key laboratory in which to study star formation in an extreme environment. Previous high-resolution (1.9 pc) dust continuum observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) discovered 14 compact, massive super star clusters (SSCs) still in formation. We present here ALMA data at 350 GHz with 28 mas (0.5 pc) resolution. We detect blueshifted absorption and redshifted emission (P-Cygni profiles) toward three of these SSCs in multiple lines, including CS 7-6 and H13CN 4-3, which represent direct evidence for previously unobserved outflows. The mass contained in these outflows is a significant fraction of the cluster gas masses, which suggests we are witnessing a short but important phase. Further evidence of this is the finding of a molecular shell around the only SSC visible at near-IR wavelengths. We model the P-Cygni line profiles to constrain the outflow geometry, finding that the outflows must be nearly spherical. Through a comparison of the outflow properties with predictions from simulations, we find that none of the available mechanisms completely explains the observations, although dust-reprocessed radiation pressure and O star stellar winds are the most likely candidates. The observed outflows will have a very substantial effect on the clusters' evolution and star formation efficiency.},

	abstract = {Using 0.2 arcsec (∼3 pc) ALMA images of vibrationally excited HC3N emission (HC3N*) we reveal the presence of eight unresolved Super Hot Cores (SHCs) in the inner 160 pc of NGC 253. Our LTE and non-LTE modelling of the HC3N* emission indicate that SHCs have dust temperatures of 200-375 K, relatively high H2 densities of (1-6) × 106 cm-3 and high IR luminosities of (0.1-1) × 108 L⊙. As expected from their short-lived phase (∼104 yr), all SHCs are associated with young super star clusters (SSCs). We use the ratio of luminosities from the SHCs (protostar phase) and from the free-free emission (ZAMS star phase), to establish the evolutionary stage of the SSCs. The youngest SSCs, with the larges ratios, have ages of a few 104 yr (proto-SSCs) and the more evolved SSCs are likely between 105 and 106 yr (ZAMS-SSCs). The different evolutionary stages of the SSCs are also supported by the radiative feedback from the UV radiation as traced by the HNCO/CS ratio, with this ratio being systematically higher in the young proto-SSCs than in the older ZAMS-SSCs. We also estimate the SFR and the SFE of the SSCs. The trend found in the estimated SFE (∼ 40 per cent for proto-SSCs and {\textgreater} 85 per cent for ZAMS-SSCs) and in the gas mass reservoir available for star formation, one order of magnitude higher for proto-SSCs, suggests that star formation is still going on in proto-SSCs. We also find that the most evolved SSCs are located, in projection, closer to the centre of the galaxy than the younger proto-SSCs, indicating an inside-out SSC formation scenario.},

	abstract = {The Milky Way's Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) has emerged in recent years as a unique laboratory for the study of star formation. Here we use the simulations presented in Tress et al. to investigate star formation in the CMZ. These simulations resolve the structure of the interstellar medium at sub-parsec resolution while also including the large-scale flow in which the CMZ is embedded. Our main findings are as follows. (1) While most of the star formation happens in the CMZ ring at \$Rrsim 100 {\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm pc\}\$, a significant amount also occurs closer to Sgr A* at \$R {\textbackslash}lesssim 10{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm pc\}\$. (2) Most of the star formation in the CMZ happens downstream of the apocentres, consistent with the 'pearls-on-a-string' scenario, and in contrast to the notion that an absolute evolutionary timeline of star formation is triggered by pericentre passage. (3) Within the time-scale of our simulations ({\textasciitilde}100 Myr), the depletion time of the CMZ is constant within a factor of {\textasciitilde}2. This suggests that variations in the star formation rate are primarily driven by variations in the mass of the CMZ, caused, for example, by active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback or externally induced changes in the bar-driven inflow rate, and not by variations in the depletion time. (4) We study the trajectories of newly born stars in our simulations. We find several examples that have age and 3D velocity compatible with those of the Arches and Quintuplet clusters. Our simulations suggest that these prominent clusters originated near the collision sites where the bar-driven inflow accretes on to the CMZ, at symmetrical locations with respect to the Galactic Centre, and that they have already decoupled from the gas in which they were born.},

	abstract = {We study the stellar cluster population in two adjacent fields in the nearby, face-on spiral galaxy M83 using multiwavelength Wide Field Camera 3/Hubble Space Telescope imaging. After automatic detection procedures, the clusters are selected through visual inspection to be centrally concentrated, symmetric, and resolved on the images, which allows us to differentiate between clusters and likely unbound associations. We compare our sample with previous studies and show that the differences between the catalogues are largely due to the inclusion of a large numbers of diffuse associations within previous catalogues as well as the inclusion of the central starburst region, where the completeness limit is significantly worse than in the surrounding regions. We derive the size distribution of the clusters, which is well described by a lognormal distribution with a peak at ∼2.5 pc, and find evidence for an expansion in the half-light radius of clusters with age. The luminosity function of the clusters is well approximated by a power law with an index of -2 over most of the observed range; however, a steepening is seen at MV=-9.3 and -8.8 in the inner and outer fields, respectively. Additionally, we show that the cluster population is inconsistent with a pure power-law mass distribution, but instead exhibits a truncation at the high-mass end. If described as a Schechter function, the characteristic mass is 1.6 × 105 and 0.5 × 105 M⊙ for the inner and outer fields, respectively, in agreement with previous estimates of other cluster populations in spiral galaxies. Comparing the predictions of the mass-independent disruption (MID) and mass-dependent disruption (MDD) scenarios with the observed distributions, we find that both models can accurately fit the data. However, for the MID case, the fraction of clusters destroyed (or mass lost) per decade in age is dependent on the environment; hence, the age and mass distributions of clusters are not universal. In the MDD case, the disruption time-scale scales with galactocentric distance (being longer in the outer regions of the galaxy) in agreement with analytic and numerical predictions. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results on other extragalactic surveys, focusing on the fraction of stars that form in clusters and the need (or lack thereof) for infant mortality.},

	abstract = {The Advanced Camera for Surveys and the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) have been used to obtain new Hubble Space Telescope images of NGC 4038/4039 ("The Antennae"). These new observations allow us to better differentiate compact star clusters from individual stars, based on both size and color. We use this ability to extend the cluster luminosity function (LF) by approximately 2 mag over our previous WFPC2 results, and find that it continues as a single power law, dN/dL vprop L α with α = -2.13 ± 0.07, down to the observational limit of MV ≈ -7. Similarly, the mass function (MF) is a single power law dN/dM vprop M β with β = -2.10 ± 0.20 for clusters with ages {\textless}3 × 108 yr, corresponding to lower mass limits that range from 104 to 105 M sun, depending on the age range of the subsample. Hence, the power-law indices for the luminosity and MFs are essentially the same. The LF for intermediate-age clusters (i.e., {\textasciitilde}100-300 Myr old objects found in the loops, tails, and outer areas) shows no bend or turnover down to MV ≈ -6, consistent with relaxation-driven cluster disruption models which predict the turnover should not be observed until MV ≈ -4. An analysis of individual {\textasciitilde}0.5 kpc sized areas over diverse environments shows good agreement between values of α and β, similar to the results for the total population of clusters in the system. There is tentative evidence that the values of both α and β are flatter for the youngest clusters in some areas, but it is possible that this is caused by observational biases. Several of the areas studied show evidence for age gradients, with somewhat older clusters appearing to have triggered the formation of younger clusters. The area around Knot B is a particularly interesting example, with a {\textasciitilde}10-50 Myr old cluster of estimated mass {\textasciitilde}106 M sun having apparently triggered the formation of several younger, more massive (up to 5 × 106 M sun) clusters along a dust lane. A comparison with new NICMOS observations reveals that only 16\% ± 6\% of the IR-bright clusters in the Antennae are still heavily obscured, with values of AV {\textgreater}3 mag.

Alternatively, those for which the crossing time exceeds the stellar age are unbound and are referred to as associations.

We confirm that the distributions are well represented by power laws: dN/dMvpropM β with β ≈ -1.9 and dN/dτvpropτγ with γ ≈ -0.8.

However, the overwhelming impression is the similarity of the mass functions and age distributions of clusters in these different galaxies, including giant and dwarf, quiescent and interacting galaxies. This is an important empirical result, justifying terms such as "universal" or "quasi-universal." We provide a partial theoretical explanation for these observations in terms of physical processes operating during the formation and disruption of the clusters, including star formation and feedback, subsequent stellar mass loss, and tidal interactions with passing molecular clouds. A full explanation will require additional information about the molecular clumps and star clusters in galaxies beyond the Milky Way.},

Their bright emission lines enable the measurement of physical properties, such as the gas-phase metallicity, across galaxy discs and in distant galaxies. The PHANGS-MUSE survey has produced optical spectroscopic coverage of the central star-forming discs of 19 nearby main-sequence galaxies. Here, we use the \${\textbackslash}rm \{H\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}alpha\$ morphology from this data to identify 30 790 distinct nebulae, finding thousands of nebulae per galaxy. For each nebula, we extract emission line fluxes and, using diagnostic line ratios, identify the dominant excitation mechanism. A total of 23 244 nebulae (75 per cent) are classified as H II regions. The dust attenuation of every nebulae is characterized via the Balmer decrement and we use existing environmental masks to identify their large-scale galactic environment (centre, bar, arm, interarm, and disc). Using strong-line prescriptions, we measure the gas-phase oxygen abundances (metallicity) and ionization parameter for all H II regions. With this new catalogue, we measure the radial metallicity gradients and explore second-order metallicity variations within each galaxy. By quantifying the global scatter in metallicity per galaxy, we find a weak negative correlation with global star formation rate and stronger negative correlation with global gas velocity dispersion (in both ionized and molecular gas). With this paper we release the full catalogue of strong line fluxes and derived properties, providing a rich data base for a broad variety of ISM studies.},

We have determined the gas phase oxygen abundances for 7138 H II regions across the disks of eight nearby galaxies using Very Large Telescope/Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) optical integral field spectroscopy as part of the PHANGS-MUSE survey. After removing the first-order radial gradients present in each galaxy, we look at the statistics of the metallicity offset (ΔO/H) and explore azimuthal variations. Across each galaxy, we find low (σ = 0.03-0.05 dex) scatter at any given radius, indicative of efficient mixing. We compare physical parameters for those H II regions that are 1σ outliers toward both enhanced and reduced abundances. Regions with enhanced abundances have high ionization parameter, higher Hα luminosity, lower Hα velocity dispersion, younger star clusters, and associated molecular gas clouds showing higher molecular gas densities. This indicates recent star formation has locally enriched the material. Regions with reduced abundances show increased Hα velocity dispersions, suggestive of mixing introducing more pristine material. We observe subtle azimuthal variations in half of the sample, but cannot always cleanly associate this with the spiral pattern. Regions with enhanced and reduced abundances are found distributed throughout the disk, and in half of our galaxies we can identify subsections of spiral arms with clearly associated metallicity gradients. This suggests spiral arms play a role in organizing and mixing the interstellar medium.},

	abstract = {We have used multiband imaging to investigate the nature of an extreme starburst environment in the nearby Lyman break galaxy analogue Haro 11 (ESO350-IG038) by means of its stellar cluster population. The central starburst region has been observed in eight different high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope (HST) wavebands, sampling the stellar and gas components from UV to near-infrared. Photometric imaging of the galaxy was also carried out at 2.16μm by NaCo AO instrument at the ESO Very Large Telescope. We constructed integrated spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for about 200 star clusters located in the active star-forming regions and compared them with single stellar population models (suitable for physical properties of very young cluster population) in order to derive ages, masses and extinctions of the star clusters. The cluster age distribution we recover confirms that the present starburst has lasted for 40Myr, and shows a peak of cluster formation only 3.5 Myr old. With such an extremely young cluster population, Haro 11 represents a unique opportunity to investigate the youngest phase of the cluster formation process and evolution in starburst systems. We looked for possible relations between cluster ages, extinctions and masses. Extinction tends to diminish as a function of the cluster age, but the spread is large and reaches the highest dispersion for clusters in partial embedded phases ({\textless}5Myr). A fraction of low-mass (below 104 Msolar), very young (1-3Myr) clusters is missing, either because they are embedded in the parental molecular cloud and heavily extinguished, or because of blending with neighbouring clusters. The range of the cluster masses is wide; we observe that more than 30 per cent of the clusters have masses above 105 Msolar, qualifying them as super star clusters. Almost half of the cluster sample is affected by flux excesses at wavelengths {\textgreater}8000Å which cannot be explained by simple stellar evolutionary models. Fitting SED models over all wavebands leads to systematic overestimates of cluster ages and incorrect masses for the stellar population supplying the light in these clusters. We show that the red excess affects also the HST F814W filter, which is typically used to constrain cluster physical properties. The clusters which show the red excess are younger than 40Myr we discuss possible physical explanations for the phenomenon. Finally, we estimate that Haro 11 has produced bound clusters at a rate almost a factor of 10 higher than the massive and regular spirals, like the Milky Way. The present cluster formation efficiency is {\textasciitilde}38 per cent of the galactic star formation rate.},

Expressed in the generic fitting formula, d 2 N/dMdtvpropM α t β, the distribution of observed clusters is described by α = -1.5 to -1.6 and β = -2.1 to -2.2. For 288 of these clusters, ages have recently been determined based on stellar photometric color-magnitude diagrams, allowing us to gauge the confidence of our ages. The results look very promising, opening up the possibility that this sample of 920 clusters, with reliable and consistent age, mass, and photometric measures, might be used to constrain important characteristics about the stellar cluster population in the LMC. We also investigate a traditional age determination method that uses a χ2 minimization routine to fit observed cluster colors to standard infinite-mass limit simple stellar population models. This reveals serious defects in the derived cluster age distribution using this method. The traditional χ2 minimization method, due to the variation of U, B, V, R colors, will always produce an overdensity of younger and older clusters, with an underdensity of clusters in the log (age/yr) = [7.0, 7.5] range. Finally, we present a unique simulation aimed at illustrating and constraining the fading limit in observed cluster distributions that includes the complex effects of stochastic variations in the observed properties of stellar clusters.},

Unlike many analysis methods, slug correctly accounts for incomplete initial mass function (IMF) sampling, and returns full posterior probability distributions rather than simply probability maxima. We apply our technique to 621 visually confirmed clusters in two nearby galaxies, NGC 628 and NGC 7793, that are part of the Legacy Extragalactic UV Survey (LEGUS). LEGUS provides Hubble Space Telescope photometry in the NUV, U, B, V, and I bands. We analyze the sensitivity of the derived cluster properties to choices of prior probability distribution, evolutionary tracks, IMF, metallicity, treatment of nebular emission, and extinction curve. We find that slug's results for individual clusters are insensitive to most of these choices, but that the posterior probability distributions we derive are often quite broad, and sometimes multi-peaked and quite sensitive to the choice of priors. In contrast, the properties of the cluster population as a whole are relatively robust against all of these choices. We also compare our results from slug to those derived with a conventional non-stochastic fitting code, Yggdrasil. We show that slug's stochastic models are generally a better fit to the observations than the deterministic ones used by Yggdrasil. However, the overall properties of the cluster populations recovered by both codes are qualitatively similar.},

	abstract = {A primary new capability of JWST is the ability to penetrate the dust in star-forming galaxies to identify and study the properties of young star clusters that remain embedded in dust and gas. In this Letter we combine new infrared images taken with JWST with our optical Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images of the starbursting barred (Seyfert2) spiral galaxy NGC 1365. We find that this galaxy has the richest population of massive young clusters of any known galaxy within 30 Mpc, with {\textasciitilde}30 star clusters that are more massive than 106 M ⊙ and younger than 10 Myr. Sixteen of these clusters are newly discovered from our JWST observations. An examination of the optical images reveals that 4 of 30 ({\textasciitilde}13\%) are so deeply embedded that they cannot be seen in the Hubble I band (A V ≳ 10 mag), and that 11 of 30 ({\textasciitilde}37\%) are missing in the HST B band, so age and mass estimates from optical measurements alone are challenging. These numbers suggest that massive clusters in NGC 1365 remain completely obscured in the visible for {\textasciitilde}1.3 ± 0.7 Myr and are either completely or partially obscured for {\textasciitilde}3.7 ± 1.1 Myr. We also use the JWST observations to gain new insights into the triggering of star cluster formation by the collision of gas and dust streamers with gas and dust in the bar. The JWST images reveal previously unknown structures (e.g., bridges and overshoot regions from stars that form in the bar) that help us better understand the orbital dynamics of barred galaxies and associated star-forming rings. Finally, we note that the excellent spatial resolution of the NIRCAM F200W filter provides a better way to separate barely resolved compact clusters from individual stars based on their sizes.},

With new data obtained as part of the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS)-JWST treasury program, we perform a detailed case study of two regions of interest, one of which contains the largest and most prominent bubble in the galaxy (the Phantom Void, over 1 kpc in diameter), and the other being a smaller region that may be the precursor to such a large bubble (the Precursor Phantom Void). When comparing to matched-resolution Hα observations from the Hubble Space Telescope, we see that the ionized gas is brightest in the shells of both bubbles, and is coincident with the youngest ({\textasciitilde}1 Myr) and most massive ({\textasciitilde}105 M ⊙) stellar associations. We also find an older generation ({\textasciitilde}20 Myr) of stellar associations is present within the bubble of the Phantom Void. From our kinematic analysis of the H I, H2 (CO), and H II gas across the Phantom Void, we infer a high expansion speed of around 15 to 50 km s-1. The large size and high expansion speed of the Phantom Void suggest that the driving mechanism is sustained stellar feedback due to multiple mechanisms, where early feedback first cleared a bubble (as we observe now in the Precursor Phantom Void), and since then supernovae have been exploding within the cavity and have accelerated the shell. Finally, comparison to simulations shows a striking resemblance to our JWST observations, and suggests that such large-scale, stellar-feedback-driven bubbles should be common within other galaxies.},

	abstract = {The first JWST observations of nearby galaxies have unveiled a rich population of bubbles that trace the stellar-feedback mechanisms responsible for their creation. Studying these bubbles therefore allows us to chart the interaction between stellar feedback and the interstellar medium, and the larger galactic flows needed to regulate star formation processes globally. We present the first catalog of bubbles in NGC 628, visually identified using Mid-Infrared Instrument F770W Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS)-JWST observations, and use them to statistically evaluate bubble characteristics. We classify 1694 structures as bubbles with radii between 6 and 552 pc. Of these, 31\% contain at least one smaller bubble at their edge, indicating that previous generations of star formation have a local impact on where new stars form. On large scales, most bubbles lie near a spiral arm, and their radii increase downstream compared to upstream. Furthermore, bubbles are elongated in a similar direction to the spiral-arm ridgeline. These azimuthal trends demonstrate that star formation is intimately connected to the spiral-arm passage. Finally, the bubble size distribution follows a power law of index p = -2.2 ± 0.1, which is slightly shallower than the theoretical value by 1-3.5σ that did not include bubble mergers. The fraction of bubbles identified within the shells of larger bubbles suggests that bubble merging is a common process. Our analysis therefore allows us to quantify the number of star-forming regions that are influenced by an earlier generation, and the role feedback processes have in setting the global star formation rate. With the full PHANGS-JWST sample, we can do this for more galaxies.},

We use a new method of constraining SED fits with infrared luminosity (SED+LIR fitting), and parameterized attenuation curves determined with the CIGALE SED-fitting code. Attenuation curve slopes and UV bump strengths are reasonably well constrained independently from one another. We find that \{A\}λ /\{A\}V attenuation curves exhibit a very wide range of slopes that are on average as steep as the curve slope of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). The slope is a strong function of optical opacity. Opaque galaxies have shallower curves—in agreement with recent radiative transfer models. The dependence of slopes on the opacity produces an apparent dependence on stellar mass: more massive galaxies have shallower slopes. Attenuation curves exhibit a wide range of UV bump amplitudes, from none to Milky Way (MW)-like, with an average strength one-third that of the MW bump. Notably, local analogs of high-redshift galaxies have an average curve that is somewhat steeper than the SMC curve, with a modest UV bump that can be, to first order, ignored, as its effect on the near-UV magnitude is 0.1 mag. Neither the slopes nor the strengths of the UV bump depend on gas-phase metallicity. Functional forms for attenuation laws are presented for normal star-forming galaxies, high-z analogs, and quiescent galaxies. We release the catalog of associated star formation rates and stellar masses (GALEX-SDSS-WISE Legacy Catalog 2).},

These maps have matched resolution (FWHM 7.″5 and 15″), matched astrometry, and a common procedure for background removal. We demonstrate that they agree well with resolved intensity measurements and integrated photometry from previous surveys. This atlas represents the first part of a program (the z = 0 Multiwavelength Galaxy Synthesis) to create a large, uniform database of resolved measurements of gas and dust in nearby galaxies. The images and associated catalogs will be publicly available at the NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive. This atlas allows us estimate local and integrated star formation rates (SFRs) and stellar masses (M ⋆) across the local galaxy population in a uniform way. In the appendix, we use the population synthesis fits of Salim et al. to calibrate integrated M ⋆ and SFR estimators based on GALEX and WISE. Because they leverage a Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)-based training set of {\textgreater}100,000 galaxies, these calibrations have high precision and allow us to rigorously compare local galaxies to SDSS results. We provide these SFR and M ⋆ estimates for all galaxies in our sample and show that our results yield a “main sequence” of star-forming galaxies comparable to previous work. We also show the distribution of intensities from resolved galaxies in NUV-to-WISE1 versus WISE1-to-WISE3 space, which captures much of the key physics accessed by these bands.},

	abstract = {Aims: To gain insight into the expected gas dynamics at the interface of the Galactic bar and spiral arms in our own Milky Way galaxy, we examine as an extragalactic counterpart the evidence of multiple distinct velocity components in the cold dense molecular gas that populates a similar region at the end of the bar in the nearby galaxy NGC 3627. Methods: We assembled a high-resolution view of molecular gas kinematics traced by CO(2-1) emission and extracted line-of-sight velocity profiles from regions of high and low gas velocity dispersion. Results: The high velocity dispersions arise with often double-peaked or multiple line-profiles. We compare the centroids of the different velocity components to expectations based on orbital dynamics in the presence of bar and spiral potential perturbations. A model of the region as the interface of two gas-populated orbits families supporting the bar and the independently rotating spiral arms provides an overall good match to the data. An extent of the bar to the corotation radius of the galaxy is favored. Conclusions: Using NGC 3627 as an extragalactic example, we expect situations like this to favor strong star formation events such as are observed in our own Milky Way since gas can pile up where the orbit families cross. The relative motions of the material following these orbits is most likely even more important for the build-up of high density in the region. The surface densities in NGC 3627 are also so high that shear at the bar end is unlikely to significantly weaken the star formation activity. We speculate that scenarios in which the bar and spiral rotate at two different pattern speeds may be the most favorable for intense star formation at such interfaces.

	abstract = {Context. In the framework of the multi-wavelength Galactic surveys of star-formation presently underway, complexes of molecular clouds that stretch over up to hundreds of parsecs are of particular interest. This is because a large population of stars is forming within them, thus all at the same distance from the Sun and under similar physical conditions. Aims: We study the Galactic plane between ≈29.5 and 31.5 degrees of longitude, which is especially rich in terms of molecular clouds and star-formation activity. It is located within what is sometimes called the molecular ring and contains the Galactic mini-starburst region W43, as well as the prominent hot core G29.96-0.02 with its associated compact HII region. Methods: We used a large database extracted from Galaxy-wide surveys of HI, 13CO 1-0, 8 μm, and 870 μm continuum to trace diffuse atomic gas, low- to medium-density molecular gas, high-density molecular gas, and star-formation activity, which we complemented by dedicated 12CO 2-1, 3-2 observations of the region. Results: From the detailed 3D (space-space-velocity) analysis of the molecular and atomic cloud tracers through the region and despite its wide velocity range (FWHM {\textasciitilde} 22.3 km s-1 around VLSR {\textasciitilde} 95.9 km s-1), we identified W43 as a large (equivalent diameter {\textasciitilde}140 pc) and coherent complex of molecular clouds that is surrounded by an atomic gas envelope (equivalent diameter {\textasciitilde}290 pc). We measured both the total mass of this newly identified molecular complex (Mtotal {\textasciitilde} 7.1 × 106 M⊙) and the mass contained in dense 870 μm clumps ({\textless}5 pc dense cloud structures, Mclumps {\textasciitilde} 8.4 × 105 M⊙), and conclude that W43 is particularly massive and concentrated. The distance that we assume for the W43 complex is 6 kpc from the Sun, which may place it at the meeting point of the Scutum-Centaurus (or Scutum-Crux) Galactic arm and the bar, a dynamically complex region where high-velocity streams could easily collide. We propose that the star-formation rate of W43 is not steady but increases from {\textasciitilde}0.01 M⊙ yr-1 (measured from its 8 μm luminosity) to {\textasciitilde}0.1 M⊙ yr-1 (measured from its molecular content). From the global properties of W43, we claim that it is an extreme molecular complex in the Milky Way and it might even form starburst clusters in the near future. Conclusions: W43 is the perfect testbed to investigate (1) the star-formation process occuring through bursts as well as (2) the formation of such an extreme complex in the framework of converging flows scenarios.

	abstract = {NGC 253 hosts the nearest nuclear starburst. Previous observations show a region rich in molecular gas, with dense clouds associated with recent star formation. We used the Atacama Large Submillimeter/Millimeter Array (ALMA) to image the 350 GHz dust continuum and molecular line emission from this region at 2 pc resolution. Our observations reveal ∼14 bright, compact (∼2-3 pc FWHM) knots of dust emission. Most of these sources are likely to be forming super star clusters (SSCs) based on their inferred dynamical and gas masses, association with 36 GHz radio continuum emission, and coincidence with line emission tracing dense, excited gas. One source coincides with a known SSC, but the rest remain invisible in Hubble near-infrared (IR) imaging. Our observations imply that gas still constitutes a large fraction of the overall mass in these sources. Their high brightness temperature at 350 GHz also implies a large optical depth near the peak of the IR spectral energy distribution. As a result, these sources may have large IR photospheres, and the IR radiation force likely exceeds L/c. Still, their moderate observed velocity dispersions suggest that feedback from radiation, winds, and supernovae are not yet disrupting most sources. This mode of star formation appears to produce a large fraction of stars in the burst. We argue for a scenario in which this phase lasts ∼1 Myr, after which the clusters shed their natal cocoons but continue to produce ionizing photons. The strong feedback that drives the observed cold gas and X-ray outflows likely occurs after the clusters emerge from this early phase.},

	abstract = {The processes of star formation and feedback, regulating the cycle of matter between gas and stars on the scales of giant molecular clouds (GMCs; {\textasciitilde}100 pc), play a major role in governing galaxy evolution. Measuring the time-scales of GMC evolution is important to identify and characterize the specific physical mechanisms that drive this transition. By applying a robust statistical method to high-resolution CO and narrow-band H α imaging from the PHANGS survey, we systematically measure the evolutionary timeline from molecular clouds to exposed young stellar regions on GMC scales, across the discs of an unprecedented sample of 54 star-forming main-sequence galaxies (excluding their unresolved centres). We find that clouds live for about 1-3 GMC turbulence crossing times (5-30 Myr) and are efficiently dispersed by stellar feedback within 1-5 Myr once the star-forming region becomes partially exposed, resulting in integrated star formation efficiencies of 1-8 per cent. These ranges reflect physical galaxy-to-galaxy variation. In order to evaluate whether galactic environment influences GMC evolution, we correlate our measurements with average properties of the GMCs and their local galactic environment. We find several strong correlations that can be physically understood, revealing a quantitative link between galactic-scale environmental properties and the small-scale GMC evolution. Notably, the measured CO-visible cloud lifetimes become shorter with decreasing galaxy mass, mostly due to the increasing presence of CO-dark molecular gas in such environment. Our results represent a first step towards a comprehensive picture of cloud assembly and dispersal, which requires further extension and refinement with tracers of the atomic gas, dust, and deeply embedded stars.},

Using the spectral energy distribution (SED) in JWST and HST bands plus ALMA and MUSE/VLT observations, we classify the sources by eye. Then we use this classification to define regions in color-color space and so establish a quantitative framework for classifying sources. We identify 1085 sources as belonging to the ISM of the target galaxies with the remainder being dusty stars or background galaxies. These 21 μm sources are strongly spatially associated with H II regions ({\textgreater}92\% of sources), while 74\% of the sources are coincident with a stellar association defined in the HST data. Using SED fitting, we find that the stellar masses of the 21 μm sources span a range of 102-104 M ⊙ with mass-weighted ages down to 2 Myr.

The synergy between these surveys has also enabled the calibration of indicators for use on scales that are comparable to those of star-forming regions, thus much smaller than an entire galaxy.

	abstract = {Understanding the rate at which stars form is central to studies of galaxy formation. Observationally, the star formation rates (SFRs) of galaxies are measured using the luminosity in different frequency bands, often under the assumption of a time-steady SFR in the recent past. We use star formation histories (SFHs) extracted from cosmological simulations of star-forming galaxies from the FIRE project to analyse the time-scales to which the H α and far-ultraviolet (FUV) continuum SFR indicators are sensitive. In these simulations, the SFRs are highly time variable for all galaxies at high redshift, and continue to be bursty to z = 0 in dwarf galaxies. When FIRE SFHs are partitioned into their bursty and time-steady phases, the best-fitting FUV time-scale fluctuates from its {\textasciitilde}10 Myr value when the SFR is time-steady to ≳100 Myr immediately following particularly extreme bursts of star formation during the bursty phase. On the other hand, the best-fitting averaging time-scale for H α is generally insensitive to the SFR variability in the FIRE simulations and remains {\textasciitilde}5 Myr at all times. These time-scales are shorter than the 100 and 10 Myr time-scales sometimes assumed in the literature for FUV and H α, respectively, because while the FUV emission persists for stellar populations older than 100 Myr, the time-dependent luminosities are strongly dominated by younger stars. Our results confirm that the ratio of SFRs inferred using H α versus FUV can be used to probe the burstiness of star formation in galaxies.},

We identified 3685 likely clusters and associations, each visually classified by their morphology, and we use the angular two-point correlation function to study the clustering of these stellar systems. We find that the spatial distribution of the young clusters and associations are clustered with respect to each other, forming large, unbound hierarchical star-forming complexes that are in general very young. The strength of the clustering decreases with increasing age of the star clusters and stellar associations, becoming more homogeneously distributed after ∼40-60 Myr and on scales larger than a few hundred parsecs. In all galaxies, the associations exhibit a global behavior that is distinct and more strongly correlated from compact clusters. Thus, populations of clusters are more evolved than associations in terms of their spatial distribution, traveling significantly from their birth site within a few tens of Myr, whereas associations show evidence of disruption occurring very quickly after their formation. The clustering of the stellar systems resembles that of a turbulent interstellar medium that drives the star formation process, correlating the components in unbound star-forming complexes in a hierarchical manner, dispersing shortly after formation, suggestive of a single, continuous mode of star formation across all galaxies.},

We combine the star cluster catalogue from the HST LEGUS (Legacy ExtraGalactic UV Survey) programme with the 15 pc resolution ALMA CO(2-1) observations. We find a strong spatial correlation between young star clusters and GMCs such that all clusters still associated with a GMC are younger than 11 Myr and display a median age of 2 Myr. The age distribution increases gradually as the cluster-GMC distance increases, with star clusters that are spatially unassociated with molecular gas exhibiting a median age of 7 Myr. Thus, star clusters are able to emerge from their natal clouds long before the time-scale required for clouds to disperse. To investigate if the hierarchy observed in the stellar components is inherited from the GMCs, we quantify the amount of clustering in the spatial distributions of the components and find that the star clusters have a fractal dimension slope of -0.35 ± 0.03, significantly more clustered than the molecular cloud hierarchy with slope of -0.18 ± 0.04 over the range 40-800 pc. We find, however, that the spatial clustering becomes comparable in strength for GMCs and star clusters with slopes of -0.44 ± 0.03 and -0.45 ± 0.06, respectively, when we compare massive ({\textgreater}105 M⊙) GMCs to massive and young star clusters. This shows that massive star clusters trace the same hierarchy as their parent GMCs, under the assumption that the star formation efficiency is a few per cent.},

The star cluster catalogues are from the Legacy ExtraGalactic UV Survey (LEGUS) and the molecular clouds from the Plateau de Bure Interefrometer Arcsecond Whirpool Survey (PAWS). We find that younger star clusters are spatially closer to molecular clouds than older star clusters. The median age for clusters associated with clouds is 4 Myr, whereas it is 50 Myr for clusters that are sufficiently separated from a molecular cloud to be considered unassociated. After ∼6 Myr, the majority of the star clusters lose association with their molecular gas. Younger star clusters are also preferentially located in stellar spiral arms where they are hierarchically distributed in kpc-size regions for 50-100 Myr before dispersing. The youngest star clusters are more strongly clustered, yielding a two-point correlation function with α = -0.28 ± 0.04, than the giant molecular cloud (GMCs) (α = -0.09 ± 0.03) within the same PAWS field. However, the clustering strength of the most massive GMCs, supposedly the progenitors of the young clusters for a star formation efficiency of a few per cent, is comparable (α = -0.35 ± 0.05) to that of the clusters. We find a galactocentric dependence for the coherence of star formation, in which clusters located in the inner region of the galaxy reside in smaller star-forming complexes and display more homogeneous distributions than clusters further from the centre. This result suggests a correlation between the survival of a cluster complex and its environment.},

	abstract = {Context. Star clusters are studied widely both as benchmarks for stellar evolution models and in their own right. Cluster age distributions and mass distributions within galaxies are probes of star formation histories and of cluster formation and disruption processes. The vast majority of clusters in the Universe are small, and it is well known that the integrated fluxes and colours of all but the most massive ones have broad probability distributions, owing to small numbers of bright stars. Aims: This paper goes beyond describing predicted probability distributions to present results of the analysis of cluster energy distributions in an explicitly stochastic context. Methods: The method developed is Bayesian. It provides posterior probability distributions in the age-mass-extinction space, using multi-wavelength photometric observations and a large collection of Monte-Carlo simulations of clusters of finite stellar masses. The main priors are the assumed intrinsic distributions of current mass and current age for clusters in a galaxy. Both UBVI and UBVIK data sets are considered, and the study conducted in this paper is restricted to the solar metallicity. Results: We first use the collection of simulations to reassess and explain errors arising from the use of standard analysis methods, which are based on continuous population synthesis models: systematic errors on ages and random errors on masses are large, while systematic errors on masses tend to be smaller. The age-mass distributions obtained after analysis of a synthetic sample are very similar to those found for real galaxies in the literature. The Bayesian approach, on the other hand, is very successful in recovering the input ages and masses over ages ranging between 20 Myr and 1.5 Gyr, with only limited systematics that we explain. Conclusions: Considering stochasticity is important, more important for instance than the choice of adding or removing near-IR data in many cases. We found no immediately obvious reason to reject priors inspired by previous (standard) analyses of cluster populations in galaxies, i.e., cluster distributions that scale with mass as M-2 and are uniform on a logarithmic age scale.},

	abstract = {Context. Stochasticity and physical parameter degeneracy problems complicate the derivation of the parameters (age, mass, and extinction) of unresolved star clusters when using broad-band photometry. Aims: We develop a method to simulate stochasticity and degeneracies and to investigate their influence on the accuracy of derived physical parameters. Then we apply it to star cluster samples of M 31 and M 33 galaxies. Methods: Age, mass, and extinction of observed star clusters are derived by comparing their broad-band UBVRI integrated magnitudes to the magnitudes of a large grid of star cluster models with fixed metallicity Z = 0.008. Masses of stars for a cluster model are randomly sampled from the initial mass function. Models of star clusters from the model grid, which have all of their magnitudes located within 3 observational errors from the magnitudes of the observed cluster, are selected for computing their age, mass, and extinction. Results: In the case of the M 31 galaxy, the extinction range is wide and the age-extinction degeneracy is strong for a fraction of its clusters. Because of a narrower extinction range, the age-extinction degeneracy is weaker for the M 33 clusters. By using artificial cluster sample, we show that age-extinction degeneracy can be reduced significantly if the range of intrinsic extinction within the host galaxy is narrow.

This includes new Arecibo observations of 208 galaxies, for which we release catalogues and H I spectra. In addition to extending the GASS H I scaling relations by one decade in stellar mass, we quantify total (atomic+molecular) cold gas fractions and molecular-to-atomic gas mass ratios, Rmol, for the subset of 477 galaxies observed with the IRAM 30 m telescope. We find that atomic gas fractions keep increasing with decreasing stellar mass, with no sign of a plateau down to log M⋆/M⊙ = 9. Total gas reservoirs remain H I-dominated across our full stellar mass range, hence total gas fraction scaling relations closely resemble atomic ones, but with a scatter that strongly correlates with Rmol, especially at fixed specific star formation rate. On average, Rmol weakly increases with stellar mass and stellar surface density μ⋆, but individual values vary by almost two orders of magnitude at fixed M⋆ or μ⋆. We show that, for galaxies on the star-forming sequence, variations of Rmol are mostly driven by changes of the H I reservoirs, with a clear dependence on μ⋆. Establishing if galaxy mass or structure plays the most important role in regulating the cold gas content of galaxies requires an accurate separation of bulge and disc components for the study of gas scaling relations.},

We present a pilot study to systematically map the dust filament network (DFN) at multiple scales between 25 and 400 pc in NGC 628. MIRI images at 7.7, 10, 11.3, and 21 μm of NGC 628 are used to generate maps of the filaments in emission, while PHANGS-HST B-band imaging yields maps of dust attenuation features. We quantify the correspondence between filaments traced by MIR thermal continuum/polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission and filaments detected via extinction/scattering of visible light; the fraction of MIR flux contained in the DFN; and the fraction of H II regions, young star clusters, and associations within the DFN. We examine the dependence of these quantities on the physical scale at which the DFN is extracted. With our highest-resolution DFN maps (25 pc filament width), we find that filaments in emission and attenuation are cospatial in 40\% of sight lines, often exhibiting detailed morphological agreement; that {\textasciitilde}30\% of the MIR flux is associated with the DFN; and that 75\%-80\% of the star formation in H II regions and 60\% of the mass in star clusters younger than 5 Myr are contained within the DFN. However, the DFN at this scale is anticorrelated with looser associations of stars younger than 5 Myr identified using PHANGS-HST near-UV imaging. We discuss the impact of these findings on studies of star formation and the interstellar medium, and the broad range of new investigations enabled by multiscale maps of the DFN.},

We obtain dust-corrected SFRs by fitting the GALEX (ultraviolet) and SDSS photometry to a library of dust-attenuated population synthesis models. For star-forming galaxies, our UV-based SFRs compare remarkably well with those from SDSS-measured emission lines (Hα). Deviations from perfect agreement are shown to be due to differences in the dust attenuation estimates. In contrast to Hα measurements, UV provides reliable SFRs for galaxies with weak Hα, and where Hα is contaminated with AGN emission (1/2 of the sample). Using full-SED SFRs, we calibrate a simple prescription that uses GALEX far- and near-UV magnitudes to produce dust-corrected SFRs for normal star-forming galaxies. The specific SFR is considered as a function of stellar mass for (1) star-forming galaxies with no AGNs, (2) those hosting an AGN, and (3) galaxies without Hα emission. We find that the three have distinct star formation histories, with AGNs lying intermediate between the star-forming and the quiescent galaxies. Star-forming galaxies without an AGN lie on a relatively narrow linear sequence. Remarkably, galaxies hosting a strong AGN appear to represent the massive continuation of this sequence. On the other hand, weak AGNs, while also massive, have lower SFRs, sometimes extending to the realm of quiescent galaxies. We propose an evolutionary sequence for massive galaxies that smoothly connects normal star-forming galaxies to quiescent galaxies via strong and weak AGNs. We confirm that some galaxies with no Hα show signs of star formation in the UV. We derive a cosmic star formation density at z=0.1 with significantly smaller total error than previous measurements.},

Galaxies with reliable signs of SF form a distinct ``main sequence'' (MS), with a limited range of SFRs at a given M* and z (1 σ{\textless}{\textasciitilde}+/-0.3 dex), and log(SFR) approximately proportional to logM*. The range of log(SFR) remains constant to z{\textgreater}1, while the MS as a whole moves to higher SFR as z increases. The range of the SFR along the MS constrains the amplitude of episodic variations of SF and the effect of mergers on the SFR. Typical galaxies spend {\textasciitilde}67\%(95\%) of their lifetime since z=1 within a factor of {\textless}{\textasciitilde}2(4) of their average SFR at a given M* and z. The dominant mode of the evolution of SF since z{\textasciitilde}1 is apparently a gradual decline of the average SFR in most individual galaxies, not a decreasing frequency of starburst episodes, or a decreasing factor by which SFRs are enhanced in starbursts. LIRGs at z{\textasciitilde}1 seem to mostly reflect the high SFR typical for massive galaxies at that epoch. The smooth MS may reflect that the same set of few physical processes governs SF prior to additional quenching processes. A gradual process like gas exhaustion may play a dominant role.},

Taking the equivalent width (EW) of the Hα emission line as a tracer of the specific star formation rate, we analyze the distribution of galaxies in the MB-EW and rotational velocity (Vmax)-EW planes. Star-forming galaxies show two characteristic transitions in these planes. A narrowing of the galaxy locus occurs at MB{\textasciitilde}-15 and Vmax{\textasciitilde}50 km s-1, where the scatter in the logarithmic EWs drops by a factor of 2 as the luminosities/masses increase, and galaxy morphologies shift from predominately irregular to late-type spiral. Another transition occurs at MB{\textasciitilde}-19 and Vmax{\textasciitilde}120 km s-1, above which the sequence turns off toward lower EWs and becomes mostly populated by intermediate- and early-type bulge-prominent spirals. Between these two transitions, the mean logarithmic EW appears to remain constant at 30 Å. We comment on how these features reflect established empirical relationships, and provide clues for identifying the large-scale physical processes that both drive and regulate star formation, with emphasis on the low-mass galaxies which dominate our approximately volume-limited sample.},

	abstract = {Using a complete sample of {\textasciitilde}300 star-forming galaxies within 11 Mpc of the Milky Way, we evaluate the consistency between star formation rates (SFRs) inferred from the far ultraviolet (FUV) non-ionizing continuum and Hα nebular emission, assuming standard conversion recipes in which the SFR scales linearly with luminosity at a given wavelength. Our analysis probes SFRs over 5 orders of magnitude, down to ultra-low activities on the order of {\textasciitilde}10-4 M sun yr-1. The data are drawn from the 11 Mpc Hα and Ultraviolet Galaxy Survey (11HUGS), which has obtained Hα fluxes from ground-based narrowband imaging, and UV fluxes from imaging with GALEX. For normal spiral galaxies (SFR {\textasciitilde} 1 M sun yr-1), our results are consistent with previous work which has shown that FUV SFRs tend to be lower than Hα SFRs before accounting for internal dust attenuation, but that there is relative consistency between the two tracers after proper corrections are applied. However, a puzzle is encountered at the faint end of the luminosity function. As lower luminosity dwarf galaxies, roughly less active than the Small Magellanic Cloud, are examined, Hα tends to increasingly underpredict the total SFR relative to the FUV. The trend is evident prior to corrections for dust attenuation, which affects the FUV more than the nebular Hα emission, so this general conclusion is robust to the effects of dust. Although past studies have suggested similar trends, this is the first time this effect is probed with a statistical sample for galaxies with SFR {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 0.1 M sun yr-1. By SFR {\textasciitilde} 0.003 M sun yr-1, the average Hα-to-FUV flux ratio is lower than expected by a factor of two, and at the lowest SFRs probed, the ratio exhibits an order of magnitude discrepancy for the handful of galaxies that remain in the sample. A range of standard explanations does not appear to be able to fully account for the magnitude of the systematic. Some recent work has argued for a stellar initial mass function which is deficient in high-mass stars in dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies, and we also consider this scenario. Under the assumption that the FUV traces the SFR in dwarf galaxies more robustly, the prescription relating Hα luminosity to SFR is re-calibrated for use in the low SFR regime when FUV data are not available.},

We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC \& COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

Combined with the PHANGS-ALMA, PHANGS-MUSE surveys and other multiwavelength data, the data set will provide an unprecedented look into the connections between young stars, H II regions, and cold molecular gas in these nearby star-forming galaxies. Accurate distances are needed to transform measured observables into physical parameters (e.g. brightness to luminosity, angular to physical sizes of molecular clouds, star clusters and associations). PHANGS-HST has obtained parallel ACS imaging of the galaxy haloes in the F606W and F814W bands. Where possible, we use these parallel fields to derive tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) distances to these galaxies. In this paper, we present TRGB distances for 10 PHANGS galaxies from {\textasciitilde}4 to {\textasciitilde}15 Mpc, based on the first year of PHANGS-HST observations. Four of these represent the first published TRGB distance measurements (IC 5332, NGC 2835, NGC 4298, and NGC 4321), and seven of which are the best available distances to these targets. We also provide a compilation of distances for the 118 galaxies in the full PHANGS sample, which have been adopted for the first PHANGS-ALMA public data release.},

	abstract = {We provide new planetary nebula luminosity function (PNLF) distances to 19 nearby spiral galaxies that were observed with VLT/MUSE by the PHANGS collaboration. Emission line ratios are used to separate planetary nebulae (PNe) from other bright \$[{\textbackslash}mathrm\{O\}{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}small III\}]\$ emitting sources like compact supernovae remnants (SNRs) or H II regions. While many studies have used narrowband imaging for this purpose, the detailed spectral line information provided by integral field unit (IFU) spectroscopy grants a more robust way of categorizing different \$[{\textbackslash}mathrm\{O\}{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}small III\}]\$ emitters. We investigate the effects of SNR contamination on the PNLF and find that we would fail to classify all objects correctly, when limited to the same data narrowband imaging provides. However, the few misclassified objects usually do not fall on the bright end of the luminosity function, and only in three cases does the distance change by more than 1σ. We find generally good agreement with literature values from other methods. Using metallicity constraints that have also been derived from the same IFU data, we revisit the PNLF zero-point calibration. Over a range of 8.34 {\textless} 12 + log (O/H) {\textless} 8.59, our sample is consistent with a constant zero-point and yields a value of \$M{\textasciicircum}\{*\} = -4.542{\textasciicircum}\{+0.103\}\_\{-0.059\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{mag\}\$, within 1σ of other literature values. MUSE pushes the limits of PNLF studies and makes galaxies beyond \$\{20\}\{{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{Mpc\}\}\$ accessible for this kind of analysis. This approach to the PNLF shows great promise for leveraging existing archival IFU data on nearby galaxies.},

	abstract = {A galaxy’s morphology stems from the secular and environmental processes taking place over the course of its evolutionary history. Thus, it has consistently served as an important tool for gaining insights into galaxy evolution. In this work, we visually classified morphologies on cloud-scales based on the molecular gas distribution of a large sample of 79 nearby main sequence galaxies, using 1″ resolution CO(2–1) ALMA observations taken as part of the PHANGS survey. For this purpose, we devised a morphology classification scheme for different types of bars, spiral arms (grand-design, flocculent, multi-arm and smooth), and rings (central and non-central rings) that are similar to the well established optical ones. Furthermore, we introduced bar lane classes. In general, our cold gas-based morphologies is in good agreement with the ones based on stellar light. Both of our bars, as well as the grand-design spiral arms, are preferentially found at the higher mass end of our sample. Our gas-based classification indicates a potential for a misidentification of unbarred galaxies in the optical when massive star formation is present. Central or nuclear rings are present in a third of the sample, with a strong preference seen for barred galaxies (59\%). As stellar bars are present in 45 ± 5\% of our sample galaxies, we explore the utility of molecular gas as tracer of bar lane properties. We find that more curved bar lanes have a shorter radial extent in molecular gas and reside in galaxies with lower molecular to stellar mass ratios than those with straighter geometries. Galaxies display a wide range of CO morphologies and this work is aimed at providing a catalogue of morphological features in a representative sample of nearby galaxies.},

(2) For Mi = 105 M⊙: (a) the median stochastic mag with gas can be {\textgreater}1.0 mag more luminous than the median stochastic magnitude without gas; and (b) nebular emission lines can contribute with \$ 50\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ and \$ 30\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ to the total emission in the V and I bands, respectively.

Our measurements are based on the application of a new fitting method tailored to CO velocity fields. Our approach identifies an optimal global orientation as a way to reduce the impact of nonaxisymmetric (bar and spiral) features and the uneven spatial sampling characteristic of CO emission in the inner regions of nearby galaxies. The method performs especially well when applied to the large number of independent lines of sight contained in the PHANGS CO velocity fields mapped at 1″ resolution. The high-resolution rotation curves fitted to these data are sensitive probes of mass distribution in the inner regions of these galaxies. We use the inner slope as well as the amplitude of our fitted rotation curves to demonstrate that CO is a reliable global dynamical mass tracer. From the consistency between photometric orientations from the literature and kinematic orientations determined with our method, we infer that the shapes of stellar disks in the mass range of log( \$\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}star \}(\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \})\$ ) = 9.0-10.9 probed by our sample are very close to circular and have uniform thickness.},

	abstract = {We explore the simple inter-relationships between mass, star formation rate, and environment in the SDSS, zCOSMOS, and other deep surveys. We take a purely empirical approach in identifying those features of galaxy evolution that are demanded by the data and then explore the analytic consequences of these. We show that the differential effects of mass and environment are completely separable to z {\textasciitilde} 1, leading to the idea of two distinct processes of "mass quenching" and "environment quenching." The effect of environment quenching, at fixed over-density, evidently does not change with epoch to z {\textasciitilde} 1 in zCOSMOS, suggesting that the environment quenching occurs as large-scale structure develops in the universe, probably through the cessation of star formation in 30\%-70\% of satellite galaxies. In contrast, mass quenching appears to be a more dynamic process, governed by a quenching rate. We show that the observed constancy of the Schechter M* and αs for star-forming galaxies demands that the quenching of galaxies around and above M* must follow a rate that is statistically proportional to their star formation rates (or closely mimic such a dependence). We then postulate that this simple mass-quenching law in fact holds over a much broader range of stellar mass (2 dex) and cosmic time. We show that the combination of these two quenching processes, plus some additional quenching due to merging naturally produces (1) a quasi-static single Schechter mass function for star-forming galaxies with an exponential cutoff at a value M* that is set uniquely by the constant of proportionality between the star formation and mass quenching rates and (2) a double Schechter function for passive galaxies with two components. The dominant component (at high masses) is produced by mass quenching and has exactly the same M* as the star-forming galaxies but a faint end slope that differs by Δαs {\textasciitilde} 1. The other component is produced by environment effects and has the same M* and αs as the star-forming galaxies but an amplitude that is strongly dependent on environment. Subsequent merging of quenched galaxies will modify these predictions somewhat in the denser environments, mildly increasing M* and making αs slightly more negative. All of these detailed quantitative inter-relationships between the Schechter parameters of the star-forming and passive galaxies, across a broad range of environments, are indeed seen to high accuracy in the SDSS, lending strong support to our simple empirically based model. We find that the amount of post-quenching "dry merging" that could have occurred is quite constrained. Our model gives a prediction for the mass function of the population of transitory objects that are in the process of being quenched. Our simple empirical laws for the cessation of star formation in galaxies also naturally produce the "anti-hierarchical" run of mean age with mass for passive galaxies, as well as the qualitative variation of formation timescale indicated by the relative α-element abundances.

We apply a watershed algorithm to density maps constructed from point source catalogues Gaussian smoothed to multiple physical scales from 8 to 64 pc. We develop our method on two galaxies that span the distance range in the PHANGS-HST sample: NGC 3351 (10 Mpc) and NGC 1566 (18 Mpc). We test our algorithm with different parameters such as the choice of detection band for the point source catalogue (NUV or V), source density image filtering methods, and absolute magnitude limits. We characterize the properties of the resulting multiscale associations, including sizes, number of tracer stars, number of associations, and photometry, as well as ages, masses, and reddening from spectral energy distribution fitting. Our method successfully identifies structures that occupy loci in the UBVI colour-colour diagram consistent with previously published catalogues of clusters and associations. The median ages of the associations increase from log(age/yr) = 6.6 to log(age/yr) = 6.9 as the spatial scale increases from 8 to 64 pc for both galaxies. We find that the youngest stellar associations, with ages {\textless}3 Myr, indeed closely trace H II regions in H α imaging, and that older associations are increasingly anticorrelated with the H α emission. Owing to our new method, the PHANGS-HST multiscale associations provide a far more complete census of recent star formation activity than found with previous cluster and compact association catalogues.},

	abstract = {The ability to determine galaxy properties such as masses, ages, and star formation rates robustly is critically limited by the ability to measure dust attenuation accurately. Dust reddening is often characterized by comparing observations to models of either nebular recombination lines or the UV continuum. Here, we use a new technique to measure dust reddening by exploiting the He II λ1640 and λ4686 emission lines originating from the stellar winds of Wolf–Rayet stars. The intrinsic line ratio is determined by atomic physics, enabling an estimate of the stellar reddening similar to how the Balmer lines probe gas-emission reddening. The He II line ratio is measured from UV and optical spectroscopy using the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope for eight nearby galaxies hosting young massive star clusters. We compare our results to dust reddening values estimated from UV spectral slopes and from Balmer line ratios and find tentative evidence for systematic differences. The reddening derived from the He II lines tends to be higher, whereas that from the UV continuum tends to be lower. A larger sample size is needed to confirm this trend. If confirmed, this may indicate an age sequence probing different stages of dust clearing. Broad He II lines have also been detected in galaxies more distant than in our sample, providing the opportunity to estimate the dust reddening of the youngest stellar populations out to distances of ∼100 Mpc.},

	abstract = {Four-color photometry of the integrated light from 61 star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds, together with a rediscussion of Danziger's multivariate spectrophotometric data for some of these same clusters, have made possible for the first time an intelligible classification scheme for their integrated spectra. It is found that the integrated spectra of populous star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds may be arranged in a one-dimensional sequence in such a way, that on traversing the sequence, all spectral features behave regularly - not necessarily monotonically, but as smoothly as can be expected from the magnitude of observational error. The character of the spectral variations along the sequence suggests that both cluster age and chemical composition vary smoothly as the sequence is traversed. The newly discovered sequence is distinctly different from the analogous one for star clusters of the Galaxy, and this fact is interpreted as indicating that the relation between epoch and average chemical composition of the interstellar medium is qualitatively different in different stellar systems.},

	abstract = {In this paper we revise the relationship between ages and metallicities of LMC star clusters and their integrated UBV colors. The study stands on the catalog of UBV colors of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) clusters by Bica et al. (1994; BCDSP) and the photometric models of single stellar populations (SSP) calculated by Bertelli et al. (1994). These photometric models nicely describe the color distribution of LMC clusters in the (U-B) vs. (B-V) plane together with the observed dispersion of the colors and the existence of a gap in a certain region of this diagram. In the case of blue clusters, most of the dispersion in the colors can be accounted for by the presence of stochastic effects on the mass distribution of stars, whereas for the red ones additional dispersion's of {\textasciitilde}0.2dex in metallicity and of {\textasciitilde}0.05mag in color excess are needed. From comparing the observed distribution of integrated colors in the (U-B) vs. (B-V) diagram with the theoretical models, it turns out that: 1) The data are consistent with the presence of a gap (period of quiescence) in the history of cluster formation. If the age-metallicity relation (AMR) for the LMC obeys the simple model of chemical evolution, the gap is well evident and corresponds to the age interval {\textasciitilde}3Gyr to (12-15)Gyr. On the contrary, if the chemical enrichment has been much slower than in the simple model, so that intermediate age clusters are less metal rich, the gap is expected to occur over a much narrower color range and to be hidden by effects of color dispersion. 2) The bimodal distribution of B-V colors can be reproduced by a sequence of clusters almost evenly distributed in the logarithm of the age, whose metallicity is governed by a normal AMR. No need is found of the so-called phase transitions in the integrated colors of a cluster taking place at suitable ages (Renzini \& Buzzoni 1986). 3) The gap noticed by BCDSP in the (U-B) vs. (B-V) plane can be explained by the particular direction along which cluster colors are dispersed in that part of the (U-B) vs. (B-V) diagram. Also in this case, no sudden changes in the integrated properties of clusters must be invoked. The results of this analysis are used to revise the empirical method proposed by Elson \& Fall (1985, EF85) to attribute ages to LMC clusters according to their integrated UBV colors. We show that the EF85 method does not provide the correct relation between ages and colors for clusters of low metallicity and hence its inability to date the old clusters. We propose two modifications to the definition of the parameter S of EF85 such that the age sequence of red clusters is suitably described, and the intrinsic errors on ages caused by the heavy presence of various effects dispersing the colors are reduced to a minimum. The age sequence is calibrated on 24 template clusters for which ages were independently derived from recent color-magnitude diagrams (CMD). Finally, we attribute ages to all clusters present in BCDSP catalog, and derive the global age distribution function (ADF) for LMC clusters. The ADF presents new features that were not clear in previous analyses of UBV data, but were already suggested by a number of independent observational studies. The features in question are periods of enhanced cluster formation at {\textasciitilde}100Myr and 1-2Gyr, and a gap in the cluster formation history between {\textasciitilde}3 and (12-15)Gyr. The peaks observed in the distribution of B-V colors are found to be sensitive to the presence of these periods of enhanced cluster formation and the lack of extremely red clusters caused by the age gap between intermediate-age and old clusters.},

The Padova tracks were extended to include the full asymptotic giant branch (AGB) evolution until the final thermal pulse over the mass range 0.9-5 Msolar. With this addition, Starburst99 accounts for all stellar phases that contribute to the integrated light of a stellar population with arbitrary age from the extreme-ultraviolet to the near-infrared. AGB stars are important for ages between 0.1 and 2 Gyr, with their contribution increasing at longer wavelengths. We investigate similarities and differences between the model predictions by the Geneva and the Padova tracks. The differences are particularly pronounced at ages {\textgreater}1 Gyr, when incompleteness sets in for the Geneva models. We also perform detailed comparisons with the predictions of other major synthesis codes and find excellent agreement. Our synthesized optical colors are compared to observations of old, intermediate-age, and young populations. Excellent agreement is found for the old globular cluster system of NGC 5128 and for old and intermediate-age clusters in NGC 4038/4039. In contrast, the models fail for red supergiant-dominated populations with subsolar abundances. This failure can be traced back to incorrect red supergiant parameters in the stellar evolutionary tracks. Our models and the synthesis code are publicly available as version 5.0 of Starburst99 at http://www.stsci.edu/science/starburst99.},

The modular structure of the code allows one easily to assess the impact on the synthetic spectral energy distribution of the various assumptions and model ingredients, such as, for example, uncertainties in stellar evolutionary models, the mixing length, the temperature distribution of horizontal branch stars, asymptotic giant branch mass loss, and colour-temperature transformations. The so-called `AGB phase transition' in Magellanic Cloud clusters is used to calibrate the contribution of the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch phase to the synthetic integrated luminosity. As an illustrative example, solar-metallicity (Y=0.27, Z=0.02) models, with ages ranging between 30 Myr and 15 Gyr and various choices for the slope of the initial mass function, are presented. Synthetic broad-band colours and the luminosity contributions of the various evolutionary stages are compared with Large Magellanic Cloud and Galactic globular cluster data. In all these cases, a good agreement is found. Finally, the evolution is presented of stellar mass-to-light ratios in the bolometric and UBVRK passbands, in which the contribution of stellar remnants is accounted for.},

In nearby galaxies, JWST observations are revolutionizing our understanding of the first phases of star formation and the dusty interstellar medium. Nineteen local galaxies spanning a range of properties and morphologies across the star-forming main sequence have been observed as part of the PHANGS-JWST Cycle 1 Treasury program at spatial scales of \${\textbackslash}sim\$5-50pc. Here, we describe pjpipe, an image processing pipeline developed for the PHANGS-JWST program that wraps around and extends the official JWST pipeline. We release this pipeline to the community as it contains a number of tools generally useful for JWST NIRCam and MIRI observations. Particularly for extended sources, pjpipe products provide significant improvements over mosaics from the MAST archive in terms of removing instrumental noise in NIRCam data, background flux matching, and calibration of relative and absolute astrometry. We show that slightly smoothing F2100W MIRI data to 0.9" (degrading the resolution by about 30 percent) reduces the noise by a factor of \${\textbackslash}approx\$3. We also present the first public release (DR1.0.1) of the pjpipe processed eight-band 2-21 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m imaging for all nineteen galaxies in the PHANGS-JWST Cycle 1 Treasury program.

Methods: BVI observations from the Advanced Camera for Surveys on board of HST are used to analyse in detail the colours, magnitudes and spatial properties of cluster candidates. The final catalogue of sources used for the study is composed by 277 objects. Results: The colour distributions of cluster candidates appear multi-modal. Although firm age constraints need the use of more age-sensitive indicators, the comparison of cluster candidate colours with the colours of Galactic and Magellanic Clouds star clusters, suggests an age difference between the various sub-peaks, with a red old sub-system, a rich population of intermediate age ({\textasciitilde}1 Gyr), and a blue tail of very young (below {\textasciitilde}100 Myr) clusters. The luminosity functions appear normal for this type of galaxy, as for the distribution of cluster effective radii (Reff). Our analysis suggests the presence of a peak in the Reff distribution at {\textasciitilde}3.0 pc, with blue (likely young) cluster candidates showing smaller radii respect to red (likely old) objects. Finally, inspecting the properties of candidate globular clusters, we find a colour distribution matching with Galactic Globulars, with a median [Fe/H] {\textasciitilde} -1.5 dex, though a non negligible tail towards lower metallicities is also present.

Why do dwarfs generally host a higher specific frequency of clusters than larger galaxies? How to connect the present-day, often resolved, stellar systems to the formation of globular clusters at high redshift? And how do these links depend on the galactic and cosmological environments of these clusters?

The observations cover the galactic centre and reach out to ∼6 kpc, thereby spanning a large range of environmental conditions, ideal for testing empirical laws of cluster disruption. The clusters are selected by visual inspection to be centrally concentrated, symmetric and resolved on the images. We find that a large fraction of objects detected by automated algorithms (e.g. SEXTRACTOR or DAOFIND) are not clusters, but rather are associations. These are likely to disperse into the field on time-scales of tens of Myr due to their lower stellar densities and not due to gas expulsion (i.e. they were never gravitationally bound). We split the sample into two discrete fields (inner and outer regions of the galaxy) and search for evidence of environmentally dependent cluster disruption. Colour-colour diagrams of the clusters, when compared to simple stellar population models, already indicate that a much larger fraction of the clusters in the outer field are older by tens of Myr than in the inner field. This impression is quantified by estimating each cluster's properties (age, mass and extinction) and comparing the age/mass distributions between the two fields. Our results are inconsistent with 'universal' age and mass distributions of clusters, and instead show that the ambient environment strongly affects the observed populations.},

	abstract = {Context. Recent studies have started to cast doubt on the assumption that most stars are formed in clusters. Observational studies of field stars and star cluster systems in nearby galaxies can lead to better constraints on the fraction of stars forming in clusters. Ultimately this may lead to a better understanding of star formation in galaxies, and galaxy evolution in general. Aims: We aim to constrain the amount of star formation happening in long-lived clusters for four galaxies through the homogeneous, simultaneous study of field stars and star clusters. Methods: Using HST/ACS and HST/WFPC2 images of the galaxies NGC 45, NGC 1313, NGC 5236, and NGC 7793, we estimate star formation histories by means of the synthetic CMD method. Masses and ages of star clusters are estimated using simple stellar population model fitting. Comparing observed and modeled luminosity functions, we estimate cluster formation rates. By randomly sampling the stellar initial mass function (SIMF), we construct artificial star clusters and quantify how stochastic effects influence cluster detection, integrated colors, and age estimates. Results: Star formation rates appear to be constant over the past 107 - 108 years within the fields covered by our observations. The number of clusters identified per galaxy varies, with a few detected massive clusters (M ≥ 105 M⊙) and a few older than 1 Gyr. Among our sample of galaxies, NGC 5236 and NGC 1313 show high star and cluster formation rates, while NGC 7793 and NGC 45 show lower values. We find that stochastic sampling of the SIMF has a strong impact on the estimation of ages, colors, and completeness for clusters with masses ≤ 103 - 104 M⊙, while the effect is less pronounced for high masses. Stochasticity also makes size measurements highly uncertain at young ages (τ ≲ 108 yr), making it difficult to distinguish between clusters and stars based on sizes. Conclusions: The ratio of star formation happening in clusters (Γ) compared to the global star formation appears to vary for different galaxies. We find similar values to previous studies (Γ ≈ 2\%-10\%), but we find no obvious relation between Γ and the star formation rate density (ΣSFR) within the range probed here (ΣSFR {\textasciitilde} 10-3 - 10-2 M⊙ yr-1 kpc-2). The Γ values do, however, appear to correlate with the specific U-band luminosity (TL(U), the fraction of total light coming from clusters compared to the total U-band light of the galaxy).

We find a large variety concerning the richness of the cluster systems, with some galaxies containing no YMCs at all and others hosting very large numbers of YMCs. Examples of galaxies with poor cluster systems are NGC 300 and NGC 4395, while the richest cluster systems are found in the galaxies NGC 5236 (M 83), NGC 2997 and NGC 1313. The age distributions of clusters in these galaxies show no obvious peaks, indicating that massive clusters are formed as an ongoing process rather than in bursts.

	abstract = {We present an analysis of correlations between integrated properties of galaxies and their populations of young massive star clusters. Data for 21 nearby galaxies presented by Larsen \& Richtler ({\textbackslash}cite\{lr99\}) are used together with literature data for 10 additional galaxies, spanning a range in specific U-band cluster luminosity T\_L(U) from 0 to 15. We find that T\_L(U) correlates with several observable host galaxy parameters, in particular the ratio of Far-Infrared (FIR) to mBox\{B-band\} flux and the surface brightness. Taking the FIR luminosity as an indicator of the star formation rate (SFR), it is found that T\_L(U) correlates very well with the SFR per unit area. A similar correlation is seen between T\_L(U) and the atomic hydrogen surface density. The cluster formation efficiency seems to depend on the SFR in a continuous way, rather than being related to any particularly violent mode of star formation. We discuss fundamental features of possible scenarios for cluster formation. One possibility is that the correlation between T\_L(U) and SFR is due to a common controlling parameter, most probably the high density of the ISM. Another scenario conceives a high T\_L(U) as resulting from the energy input from many massive stars in case of a high SFR. Based on observations made with the Nordic Optical Telescope, operated on the island of La Palma jointly by Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, in the Spanish Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos of the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias, and with the Danish 1.5-m telescope at ESO, La Silla, Chile.},

	abstract = {We use hydrodynamical simulations to study the Milky Way's central molecular zone (CMZ). The simulations include a non-equilibrium chemical network, the gas self-gravity, star formation, and supernova feedback. We resolve the structure of the interstellar medium at sub-parsec resolution while also capturing the interaction between the CMZ and the bar-driven large-scale flow out to \$R{\textbackslash}sim 5{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm kpc\}\$. Our main findings are as follows: (1) The distinction between inner (R ≲ 120 pc) and outer (120 ≲ R ≲ 450 pc) CMZ that is sometimes proposed in the literature is unnecessary. Instead, the CMZ is best described as single structure, namely a star-forming ring with outer radius R ≃ 200 pc which includes the 1.3° complex and which is directly interacting with the dust lanes that mediate the bar-driven inflow. (2) This accretion can induce a significant tilt of the CMZ out of the plane. A tilted CMZ might provide an alternative explanation to the ∞-shaped structure identified in Herschel data by Molinari et al. (3) The bar in our simulation efficiently drives an inflow from the Galactic disc (R ≃ 3 kpc) down to the CMZ (R ≃ 200 pc) of the order of \$1{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}, M\_{\textbackslash}odot {\textbackslash}, yr{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, consistent with observational determinations. (4) Supernova feedback can drive an inflow from the CMZ inwards towards the circumnuclear disc of the order of \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}0.03{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm M\_{\textbackslash}odot {\textbackslash}, yr{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. (5) We give a new interpretation for the 3D placement of the 20 and 50 km s-1 clouds, according to which they are close (R ≲ 30 pc) to the Galactic Centre, but are also connected to the larger scale streams at R ≳ 100 pc.},

	abstract = {We study young massive clusters (YMCs) in their embedded "infant" phase with \${\textbackslash}sim\$0.1" ALMA, HST, and JWST observations targeting the central starburst ring in NGC 3351, a nearby Milky Way analog galaxy. Our new ALMA data reveal 18 bright and compact (sub-)millimeter continuum sources, of which 11 have apparent counterparts in JWST images and only 6 have counterparts in HST images. Based on the ALMA continuum and molecular line data, as well as ancillary measurements for the HST and JWST counterparts, we identify 14 sources as infant star clusters with high stellar and/or gas masses (\$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}10{\textasciicircum}5{\textbackslash};{\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_{\textbackslash}odot\}\$), small radii (\$\{{\textbackslash}lesssim\}{\textbackslash},5{\textbackslash};{\textbackslash}mathrm\{pc\}\$), large escape velocities (\$6\{-\}10{\textbackslash};{\textbackslash}mathrm\{km/s\}\$), and short free-fall times (\$0.5\{-\}1{\textbackslash};{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Myr\}\$). Their multiwavelength properties motivate us to divide them into four categories, likely corresponding to four evolutionary stages from starless clumps to exposed HII region-cluster complexes. Leveraging age estimates for HST-identified clusters in the same region, we infer an evolutionary timeline going from \$1\{-\}2{\textbackslash};{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Myr\}\$ before cluster formation as starless clumps, to \$4\{-\}6{\textbackslash};{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Myr\}\$ after as exposed HII region-cluster complexes. Finally, we show that the YMCs make up a substantial fraction of recent star formation across the ring, exhibit an non-uniform azimuthal distribution without a very coherent evolutionary trend along the ring, and are capable of driving large-scale gas outflows.},

	abstract = {We present the results of a James Webb Space Telescope NIRCam investigation into the young massive star cluster (YMC) population in the luminous infrared galaxy VV 114. We identify 374 compact YMC candidates with signal-to-noise ratios ≥ 3, 5, and 5 at F150W, F200W, and F356W, respectively. A direct comparison with our HST cluster catalog reveals that {\textasciitilde}20\% of these sources are undetected at optical wavelengths. Based on yggdrasil stellar population models, we identify 17 YMC candidates in our JWST imaging alone with F150W - F200W and F200W - F356W colors suggesting they are all very young, dusty (A V = 5-15), and massive (105.8 {\textless} M ⊙ {\textless} 106.1). The discovery of these "hidden" sources, many of which are found in the "overlap" region between the two nuclei, quadruples the number of t {\textless} 3 Myr clusters and nearly doubles the number of t {\textless} 6 Myr clusters detected in VV 114. Now extending the cluster age distribution ( \$\{dN\}/d{\textbackslash}tau {\textbackslash}propto \{{\textbackslash}tau \}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}gamma \}\$ ) to the youngest ages, we find a slope of γ = -1.30 ± 0.39 for 106 {\textless} τ(yr) {\textless} 107, which is consistent with the previously determined value from 107 {\textless} τ(yr) {\textless} 108.5, and confirms that VV 114 has a steep age distribution slope for all massive star clusters across the entire range of cluster ages observed. Finally, the consistency between our JWST- and HST-derived age distribution slopes indicates that the balance between cluster formation and destruction has not been significantly altered in VV 114 over the last 0.5 Gyr.},

He 2-10 is also one of the first galaxies in which embedded super star clusters (SSCs) were discovered. SSCs are massive, compact star clusters that will impact their host galaxies dramatically when their massive stars evolve. Here, we discuss radio, submillimeter, and infrared observations of He 2-10 from 1.87 μm to 6 cm in high angular resolution ({\textasciitilde}0.3″), which allows us to disentangle individual clusters from aggregate complexes as identified at lower resolution. These results indicate the importance of spatial resolution to characterize SSCs, as low resolution studies of SSCs average over aggregate complexes that may host SSCs at different stages of evolution. We explore the thermal, nonthermal, and dust emission associated with the clusters along with dense molecular tracers to construct a holistic review of the natal SSCs that have yet to dramatically disrupt their parent molecular clouds. We assess the production rate of ionizing photons, extinction, total mass, and the star formation efficiency (SFE) associated with the clusters. Notably, we find that the SFE for the some of the natal clusters is high ({\textgreater}70\%), which suggests that these clusters could remain bound even after the gas is dispersed from the system from stellar feedback mechanisms. If they remain bound, these SSCs could survive to become objects indistinguishable from globular clusters.},

Images obtained with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) on board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in F435W (B), F555W (V), and F814W (I) filters were used in the search for the clusters. We detected 653 clusters, of which 393 are located outside the central 450 pc in the poststarburst disk of M82. The luminosity function of the detected clusters shows an apparent turnover at B = 22 mag (MB = - 5.8), which we interpret from Monte Carlo simulations as due to incompleteness in the detection of faint clusters, rather than an intrinsic lognormal distribution. We derived a photometric mass of every detected cluster from models of simple stellar populations assuming a mean age of either 8 (nuclear clusters) or 100 (disk clusters) million years old. The mass functions of the disk (older) and the nuclear (younger) clusters follow power laws, the former being marginally flatter (α = 1.5 +/- 0.1) than the latter (α = 1.8 +/- 0.1). The distribution of sizes (FWHM) of clusters brighter than the apparent turnover magnitude (mass gtrsim2 × 104 M⊙) can be described by a lognormal function. This function peaks at 10 pc for clusters more massive than 105 M⊙, whereas for lower masses, the peak is marginally shifted to larger values for the younger and smaller values for the older clusters. The observed trend toward flattening of the mass function with age, together with an overabundance of older compact clusters, imply that cluster disruption in M82 is both dependent on the mass and size of the clusters.},

We carry out the dynamical and photometric evolution of the CMF assuming that the clusters move in circular orbits under the gravitational potential of the host galaxy using the semi-analytical simulation code Evolve Me a Cluster of StarS. We explore power-law and lognormal functions for the CIMFs, and populate the clusters in the disc assuming uniform, power-law, and exponential radial distribution functions. We find that the observed CMF is best produced by a CIMF that is power law in form with an index of 1.8, for a power-law radial distribution function. More importantly, we establish that the observed turn-over in the present-day CMF is the result of observational incompleteness rather than due to dynamically induced effects, or an intrinsically lognormal CIMF, as was proposed for the fossil starburst region B of this galaxy. Our simulations naturally reproduce the mass-radius relation observed for a sub-sample of M82 SSCs.},

We discuss models with zero rotation velocity and with velocities of 40\% of the break-up velocity on the zero-age main-sequence. These values are expected to bracket realistic rotation velocity distributions in stellar populations. The new rotating models for massive stars are more luminous and hotter due to a larger convective core and enhanced surface abundances. This results in pronounced changes in the integrated spectral energy distribution of a population containing massive stars. The changes are most significant at the shortest wavelengths where an increase of the ionizing luminosity by up to a factor of five is predicted. We also show that high equivalent widths of recombination lines may not necessarily indicate a very young age but can be achieved at ages as late as {\textasciitilde}107 yr. Comparison of these two boundary cases (0\% and 40\% of the break-up velocity) will allow users to evaluate the effects of rotation and provide guidance for calibrating the stellar evolution models. We also introduce a new theoretical ultraviolet spectral library built from the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet atmospheres. Its purpose is to help identify signatures of Wolf-Rayet stars in the ultraviolet whose strength is sensitive to the particulars of the evolution models. The new models are available for solar and one-seventh solar metallicities. A complete suite of models can be generated on the Starburst99 Web site.

The high angular resolution, extensive cluster inventory, and full near-ultraviolet to near-infrared photometric coverage make the LEGUS data set excellent for this study. We account for both stellar and nebular emission in the models and try two different prescriptions for attenuation by dust. From Bayesian fits of model libraries to the observations, we find remarkably low dispersion in the median E(B - V) (∼0.03 mag), stellar masses (∼104 M⊙), and ages (∼1 Myr) derived for individual clusters using different models, although maximum discrepancies in these quantities can reach 0.09 mag and factors of 2.8 and 2.5, respectively. This is for ranges in median properties of 0.05-0.54 mag, 1.8-10 × 104 M⊙, and 1.6-40 Myr spanned by the clusters in our sample. In terms of best fit, the observations are slightly better reproduced by models with interacting binaries and least well reproduced by models with single rotating stars. Our study provides a first quantitative estimate of the accuracies and uncertainties of the most recent spectral synthesis models of young stellar populations, demonstrates the good progress of models in fitting high-quality observations, and highlights the needs for a larger cluster sample and more extensive tests of the model parameter space.},
